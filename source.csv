However, I realize this is a step-by-step process that involves dedication, patience, and hard work.
Over the past several years I have slowly built up my programming skills, starting with simple websites and games in summer classes to having an internship as a software engineer and creating my own app. Progress never came easy, but it was always worth it. If the middle school me saw the projects I had accomplished several years later, he would be dumbfounded. Now, I am anticipating the same happening for my future.
As I was learning more about programming, I also gained familiarity with the world of business. The more I learned about it, the more interested I got. Hearing about and interacting with companies, small and big, made me see in real time where people found success and failure.
Now, I am ready to combine both worlds into one.
","My purpose in V1 is to take steps towards my dream of combining Computer Science and Business. Through this organization, I want to gain hands-on experience in tech entrepreneurship and put my skills to use. I believe I have a lot to offer when it comes to my CS skills and business intuition. However, I also have a lot to learn, so why not both at the same time. 
At V1, my goal is to help our team make the best possible products, while also gaining invaluable experience and wisdom from the community.

At UCSB’s Media Neuroscience Lab, I employed an open-source BERT classifier to quantify political bias of Tweets and developed an nationally-recognized Next.js web app, Nütrl, that measures political persuasion in news articles. At Berkeley's 2023 AI hackathon, my team integrated vocal and facial expressions with GPT-4 to create Prosody, an adaptive interview simulator.

Witnessing the demand for context-aware tools, I drew from my ML experience to develop Gem, a React Native/TypeScript app that features retrieval-augmented generation and OpenAI LLM agents. At U-M, I am performing ML research that leverages graph neural networks for drug property prediction. 

My journey has taught me that development isn’t linear. Each project built upon the previous: UCSB introduced me to the NLP used in Nütrl, Nütrl to the web technologies in Prosody, and both to the core ML used in Gem and beyond.

Embracing nonlinearity, I take a purpose-driven approach to building. It is in unexpected tangents that I find my best ideas.","Building offers more than new JavaScript frameworks and problem-solving skills; it's about moments of curiosity, insight, and laughter. I believe that a positive developer experience comes from individuals, not technology. I see no better place to immerse myself in a new community than V1.

From developing software that revolutionizes people’s daily routines to uniting people around a passion for building, V1 is people-centric in every sense of the word. It is this emphasis on people-first development—technical, professional, and personal—that is deeply appealing to me. 

As a user-centric developer, I am excited by the opportunity to ideate and execute alongside peers who are as passionate about uniting people and technology. To the table I bring the perseverance, communication, and, most importantly, humor, to develop collaboratively and through the lens of an end user. 

At V1, I can 10X myself and the community around me without losing sight of the human element.

My time with the Michigan Data Science Team (MDST) was marked by a practical endeavor—I developed a web scraping system to automate the collection of job listings, enabling members to access vast ranges of internship opportunities through the club repo. 

Diving into the realm of quantitative finance, I embarked on a project that used a mean reversion strategy to inform trading decisions. The result was a clean, user-friendly interface that offers actionable insights on when to enter or exit stock positions.

In the entrepreneurial space, seeing the market gap between Chinese and US  jewelry market,  I collaborated with peers to co-found a drop shipping startup aimed at bridging the gap by introducing medium-tier Chinese jewelry to the US.  Pitching our idea in Chinese Entrepreneurship Network, we won the first prize and receive funding for launching the startup. 

Despite the excitement of entrepreneurship, my true calling remains within the bounds of computer science—using the power of technology to create practical solutions for everyday problems.","I'm enthusiastic about joining V1 due to its vibrant community that embodies a blend of business acumen and technological innovation. The project studio environment is particularly appealing, as it offers a dynamic platform for brainstorming solutions to pressing societal issues. I am keen to cultivate deeper interpersonal relationships, as well as to sharpen my creativity and critical thinking abilities within this setting.

Additionally, I'm attracted to the culture at V1 that nurtures the development of tangible business initiatives. Solo ideation can sometimes lead to a biased view of business concepts. However, at V1, the collective insight in a team setting and mentorship available ensure a well-rounded approach to business planning, increasing the prospects for successful launches.

I witnessed the scattered dull pieces on the plastic runner snapping and assembling into something much more, exceeding their individual worth. I was engrossed in the idea of building something cool, fun, and intricate to fulfill my imagination’s thirst.


It wasn’t until I delved into video games that I took my endeavours into the digital world. Slowly, I dedicated my building not to myself, but to other people – players you can say. I started tinkering with Unity with a group of friends where we created 5 games with genres ranging from horror to roleplaying.


Much later, I believed I could use my skills for a broader demographic and wanted to explore other sides of computer science, so I started collaborating and developing websites for charity projects, data analysis, and financial informatics. 


Of all of this, I view building as something that challenges me to improve myself and to constantly think outside the box. I hope to continue this passion with like-minded developers at V1, and further develop my skills socially and professionally.","When I look to V1, I see a hub for driven developers to collaborate. I see an incubator for developers to go buck-wild with whatever their minds can whizz up. I see ambition where developers tirelessly bring an idea to fruition. 

After the many gunplas and websites, I desire to continue building at a university level. Ever since my internship at Wall’s Ice Cream, I’ve come to value technology as a catalyst to better communities as I am driven to help others with my computer science.

Embracing ambitious ideas, I anticipate the opportunity to challenge and contribute my honed communication and digital skills at V1. I believe with the connections and resources available at V1, I can propel my building endeavors to broader horizons.

Finally, I hope to bring a unique perspective to V1, blending my American-born identity with the cultural lens of a Thai.","I absolutely cannot have blueberries as I will die from them and my uniqname, courtesy of my dad, has cs in it.","Jonathan momomomomo"

I am deeply passionate about problem-solving and creating products that contribute positively to society. In my journey, I have undertaken various tech-related projects, each aimed at serving the community and leaving a lasting impact. One notable project from my recent Entrepreneurship class was the development of a thoughtful thinking coach app.

This app was designed to facilitate guided reflections, enabling users to delve deeper into their actions and decisions. I believe that introspection is a powerful tool for personal growth, and this app aimed to harness that potential. Users could engage in thoughtful exercises, encouraging them to ponder over their choices and learn from the outcomes.

The motivation behind this project stemmed from my interest in entrepreneurship and the belief that technology can be a force for positive change. I am driven by the desire to create solutions that not only address immediate needs but also foster personal development and learning.","I am drawn to V1 due to its unique blend of technology and entrepreneurship, aligning perfectly with my passion for creating impactful tech solutions.

While I currently focus on pure mathematics and theoretical computer science, I also find myself interested in their applications, as well as the ways in which they can be used for social benefit through the world of entrepreneurship.

In terms of projects, I am the co-creator of an extension with +30'000 users in +70 countries (see my resume for more details), as well as the creator of the Antioquia chess league website (my homestate back in Colombia) that was in use during 2021 - 2022. I have also served as a cybersecurity consultant for the start-up Interacpedia, and the educational services company Akros.

However, as Thanos rightly said: ""Not everything in life is academics"".... Or well, he didn't say that, but he did mention something about a balance, one that I found while being a volunteer programming teacher in my hometown, an experience that has motivated me to start a project (still in development - provisionally called ""CodeTest""... I know, I'm really bad with names :b) which aims to facilitate the teaching of programming in schools in a didactic and interactive way.
","The connection between the world of technology and business has always appealed to me, and I see V1 as the perfect representation of it.

I first learned to code in service of my interest in game development during middle and high school, which led me to learn a diverse array of programming languages such as Javascript, Python, and Java. My most recent gamedev project, MagiBlade, is a retro-inspired 2D platforming game developed in C# and Unity. My interest in genAI began much more recently during a summer internship at St. Jude Children's Hospital in Memphis, where I contributed to a project addressing the limitations of ChatGPT in biomedical queries. This evolved into Llamology, a biomedically trained tool that integrates an LLM with a semantic search engine. Once public, Llamology aims to improve biomedical query responses by allowing users to upload a custom database of text, audio, or video files that will be pulled as context to answer user queries. Motivated by this experience, I participated in the +Tech Innovation Jam last semester, collaborating with a team of 3 MBAs and a senior in Biology to design DiagnosAI. This hypothetical genAI tool facilitates rapid iteration of hospital treatment protocols by searching reputable medical journals for the latest advancements and incorporating relevant context into an LLM for protocol revisions.","I am interested in V1 because of its status as a diverse, innovative community that shares my passion for cutting-edge technology and collaboration.

For instance, a recurring problem in California is rolling electricity blackouts. I used my final project in Advanced Data Structures and Algorithms in Python to construct an electric grid using a max flow algorithm, in order to represent how the decision-making was performed for the power grid. Ultimately, my electrical grid simulation showed why the power outages were necessary to prevent a statewide outage. Last year, I worked on research in the Ye Neurobiology Lab at U-M and developed software for the lab, using machine-vision and machine-learning, which allowed for dynamic background removal in highly complex scenes. Last semester, I embarked on a continuation of this research to find undiscovered patterns of behaviors in animals through a process of extracting sequences from a time series dataset including all identified singular behaviors. I am excited to see this software be used to identify complex sequential behaviors which have potentially never been identified before. I love being able to use technology to help me understand and unravel the world around me.","V1 will help me move beyond the typical focus on additive technology and explore the entrepreneurial side of technology.

Alongside four other friends, we began a coalition called Artists for Black Lives Equality (The ABLE Initiative), where we created art and donated all proceeds to organizations fighting racial inequity. Through trial and error and consistent outreach to external organizations, we fleshed out our operating model and fostered incredible collaborations. Since our conception, we’ve hosted over 30 volunteers, donated $3000 to various charities, and partnered with institutions ranging from museums to the Department of Education. I’ve taken my brand development and communicative skills into a startup where we’ve integrated EEG technology into wireless earbuds to increase accessibility to brain healthcare. While I lacked the engineering and research knowledge, I was fascinated by a venture so dedicated to bridging the same inequities that I saw so clearly in my nonprofit work.

More recently, I’ve been interested in improving the user experience and functionality of “everyday use” products. I’ve always had an itch for entrepreneurship, trying out oversaturated side hustles and basic service-providing initiatives. It wasn’t until I was referred to my future co-worker that my perception of meaningful entrepreneurship would change. This summer, I worked for a local serial entrepreneur with several ongoing, large-scale projects. On top of his projects, he was eager to get involved in real estate, an industry I pride myself in knowing well. I conducted several interviews with his current and prospective tenants, which helped me draft a design plan for an all-encompassing tenant and property management platform to solve the issues of customers and landlords. Alongside two developers, we created a highly functional and aesthetically pleasing interface for the property management team and current/future tenants called surplusholdings.com. This very successful project taught me many lessons and has inspired me to continue designing and developing projects like this in the future. I am confident that my passion for entrepreneurship will only continue to grow.

Nervously sitting in an Engineering course in ninth grade, I felt appalled seeing such a male-dominated classroom. 


Recognizing that this imbalance also represented the STEM workforce, I sought to diminish such gender biases. 


As the Associate Director for Louisville’s STEM You Can! (SYC)–an organization that exposes young girls to STEM–I began developing a program to take SYC down new avenues. 


Up to this point, SYC held a few local summer camps. I laid out goals to hold accessible virtual workshops and programs year-round, do demonstrations at schools, develop diverse curriculums, recruit a specialized, wide-spread executive team, and engage in networking.


To accomplish this, I updated SYC’s website and social media to be more visually-appealing, informative, and active. To promote the organization, fundraise, and recruit members, flyers were shared with community centers, Facebook pages, and more. Then, STEM workshops were designed based on accessibility, the topic of focus, necessary materials, etc.


The first few workshops were still primarily composed of Louisville volunteers and attendees. However, through persistence, SYC now has members worldwide. 


This project was able to empower girls to feel confident to pursue STEM, which was evident through participant and parent testimonials.

I’ve been interested in finding ways to marry technology with my day-to-day activities, and I’ve learned to automate many processes in my life. A project I’ve done in the past involving IoT was an app capable of classifying motion data from one’s phone, whereby the signal produced corresponds to a task being done. The inspiration for this project was, funnily enough, Harry Potter. In Harry Potter, a specific wand movement corresponds to a specific spell being invoked, like an “L” representing Expelliarmus. I thought about recreating that concept, but I figured I could elevate it by having the motion data signal “turn on the TV” or another task. In that vein, IoT helps channel my entrepreneurial spirit. Simply put, I begin with a problem, and I brainstorm ways to solve the problem with technology. Oftentimes, these problems are problems relatable to a broad assortment of people. I get excited thinking about how far-reaching the solutions to these problems are capable of being, and this was primarily what got me into the entrepreneurial space. IoT, for me, essentially provides a pipeline to this. 
","What excites me particularly about joining V1 is the prospect of connecting with the diverse club cohort that rallies together under the entrepreneurial, solution-driven spirit. I’m looking forward to hashing out ideas, along with the spontaneous conversations between my fellow V1 members. Engineering is inherently collaborative, with certain systems requiring contributions from a variety of specialists. Knowledge cannot be unearthed without the efforts of a community. V1 provides a forum and platform to share one’s ideas openly and unfettered, while feeding new perspectives, thus creating a unique flywheel of ideas, so to speak.  As a prospective engineering student, I would surely take advantage of different events offered by V1, such as Startup Fair and Demo day. I’m excited to further the spirit of discovery, collaboration and inquiry through V1.

As VP, I used my influence to generate interest in the club beyond the typical STEM activities to secure higher participation and successfully hosting the 3v3 basketball fundraiser. I found planning the event difficult as many officers either planned on participating in the event themselves or were sick. As the only senior officer remaining, I'd use my gut instinct to make decisions regarding the events. STEM club is relatively new, and we received no funding from the school. To finance everything, including food and prizes, I contacted 20+ businesses virtually and physically, for sponsorships. I also worked with school directors for operating permission. During the fundraiser, I solely oversaw games and created scoreboards, delegating other tasks to volunteers like the ticket booth and timing system. Although the fundraiser being new territory made it stressful, I pushed through by managing my time and resources. In addition to working with others, I learned that with problems, it’s important to persevere and be spontaneous, and flexible with the plan at hand. Had I not stepped up and taken initiative, it is likely the event wouldn't have happened in the end, much less to the success of having 100+ people attend.","As a first-year with an interest in entrepreneurship and data science but no set path or experience, I sought out many entrepreneurial related clubs. Despite many with the same perks, V1 struck out to me as unique in its own right. 

While V1’s emphasis on no experience in its members was a major perk, I also saw its opportunity with first-hand experience for new members so interesting. V1 specializes in creating new and innovative projects, VVI places its trust in new and inexperienced members. This strategy would not only give me experience with up-and-coming successful businesses, I can learn otherwise creative skills and see success as it builds up.

Additionally, V1 lets its members work on a variety of aspects of the project, many of which I have interest in learning more about. If I was to participate in a variety of these aspects, I can possibly find which area I feel passionate about and build on my expertise in that discipline.","I love style and thrifting.

Exploring digital music led me to the realization of technology's power in solving complex problems across various domains. From static websites to Python projects, I embraced programming as a tool for innovation.

During COVID, I solved a problem I faced at Spelling Bee competitions. Participants are provided a list of words to prepare. It's tedious to search for each word to get all the required information. My app made it easy to do this, saving hours of work. This reinforced that I could solve problems through technology. 

Last summer, I identified a gap in campus information accessibility. Motivated to bridge this, I developed a campus tour website for both the University of Michigan and Michigan State University.

My recent projects include ""iMessage Wrapped,"" an application that analyzes a user's iMessage history and a machine learning disease predictor model. Additionally, I contributed to the WordPress iOS open-source project.

My journey reflects a blend of technical skills, problem-solving ability, and a commitment to making a positive impact through entrepreneurship.","I want to join V1 so I can contribute to a passionate community where I can collaborate with fellow innovators and learn from diverse perspectives.

This full-stack website, built using Django and Python, showcases my skills in both web development and machine learning. 

The objective of OrganAIze was to simplify the course selection process. By parsing the university’s database of courses, I developed an algorithm that associated a score to each class based on the relevance to a student’s input prompt such as “I want to learn more about machine learning.” Furthermore, I designed a user account system and a Django-based frontend which allowed students to effortlessly receive personalized class recommendations. 

This project was not just a testament to my technical abilities but also a stepping stone into entrepreneurship. It highlighted the impact technology can have in simplifying unnecessarily difficult tasks, fueling my drive to innovate and create solutions that make a difference.

If I were a monk in a bamboo forest, living on dew and honey, I'd still bring a laptop to start a platform connecting monks and scheduling meditations. Ideally, I wouldn't be a monk but instead work with a team, deciding on business strategies for digital products. This motivation began in middle school when my favorite pastime was wandering malls and analyzing each store's core competency. However, it took a long time to realize my true passion was creating meaningful digital products.
They say your envy can signify what truly matters to you. My first encounter with such envy was towards BeReal. How did they manage to gain so many users through sheer creativity and an understanding of psychology? Why wasn't it me! That moment made me realize my interest lies in creating life-changing digital products. This drive continued after I created a resolution/meditation assistant, hosted on GitHub Pages, designed to help my brother be more productive. Since then, I've experimented with various tools and APIs, always aiming to create something scalable and meaningful, addressing issues I deeply care about

"," Meeting people through attending events like Mhacks made V1 really standout to me. Seeing the clothing exchange web app and the creators sharing with their faces lit up got me excited as well. I have been building solo for a year and I have a great idea I can’t wait to share with you guys.
I want to become lifelong friends with like minded people and create things that excite us no matter how many times we need to pitch it. I hope I can find friends that build with me and a space to dream boldly. We could harvest ideas from our stories and watch it seed and bud, or laugh and learn from our failures. I will bring with me my ideas (that need constructive criticism), web dev knowledge from youtube and design skills. Let’s build something together, or twiddle our thumbs when we are tired of building.

For over a year, I had been trying to find indicators to determine the best entry and exit times for equity trades. After incorporating the machine learning concepts I learned, I finally found a pattern and devised a strategy that would have yielded a 102% return in 2023. I am now testing it with real cash.

In addition to my recent projects, I also co-founded and ran the Investment and Finance Club back in high school. Together, we explored cryptos and NFTs, made some spending money, and learned painful, but important, lessons.

Aside from investment, I’ve also invented gadgets to solve problems I’ve personally faced. For example, I’ve designed and wrote a patent application for a bug catcher that uses vibrations to shake pests into traps. I’ve also designed, wrote, and was awarded a patent for a collapsible binder that saves space in backpacks.","I am drawn to V1’s blend of technology and entrepreneurship and focus on delivering products and results.

In college, I have been focusing on making my own projects, ranging from topics such as hardware to web development. I recently developed a full-stack web app named Tastebuddies. Within this app, users can rate, review, and search for items at local restaurants and dining halls. The purpose of this app is to encourage people to try new foods with confidence, while also bringing exposure to lesser known restaurants. Tastebuddies aims to provide a social media type experience to explore local cuisine, making the experience more enjoyable. I originally came up with this idea to encourage my mom to try new foods. This project is a highlight of my builder journey because it showcases my passion for making my ideas a reality. Additionally, throughout developing this project, I learned a lot about web development and user experience, skills that will help me succeed as a cohort member. 
","I am interested in joining V1 so I can be part of a community of people that I can learn from.

As for what I can contribute, as a previous programming leader for my Robotics team and a captain for my Track team, I can work well with and provide leadership for a vast variety of different teams. Additionally, my previous projects, specifically regarding web/project development show I have the necessary skills to be an effective member of this community.

Every day checking on the quality, sales, and marketing of the company kept us excited because it is so unpredictable. 

I became less involved with the company right now as I wanted to focus more on my uni-life. Joining clubs, making friends, and anything else.

Last summer, I took that knowledge to Raudat, a program where young children come to memorize the Quran. There I saw a product opportunity. Their teachers had a tedious grading system which caused them to drop marking completely. I thought - could I make something to help? - so I came up with a system on google sheets.

One idea that I was able to bring to life at MHACKS is a skill-learning finance app aimed to promote financial literacy by using articles found on the internet and outlining ""pathways""  to help users identify the articles they should be reading to gain a depth of finance knowledge. In robotics, I have worked on some incredible projects that incorporated autonomous path planning and computer vision and allowed individuals to draw a path in an app and the robot would follow that path. All in all, V1 would be a great way to realize my ambitions and work with a diverse collection of individuals who can transform my idea into impact.  ","V1 offers a compelling next step for my pursuit of entrepreneurship and computer science. This year, I participated in my first hackathon, which was MHACKS16. It was a truly eye-opening experience. For one, I had a breakthrough in how I could use generative AI and large language models to enhance my skills and not replace them. Working with other individuals in a tight-knit community formed in just 24 hours helped me see a glimpse of how close of a community I will find in V1. The V1 community has the mentorship, community, training, and opportunity that rocks the niche of entrepreneurship and tech. I humbly believe that I could contribute to this environment through my understanding of the finance space, to potentially synthesize it with other's tech expertise. From working with remarkable speakers, like those at MHACKS, to sharing laughs with peers, I know V1 will become my second home.","A fun fact about me is that I can learn how to play board games and sports fast using Chat-GPT summaries and visuals, but I am horrendous at picking up new video games. For example, I ran cross-country, wrestled, swam, high-jumped, sprinted in track, played tennis, play outside hitter in rec-volleyball, and turn into JJ Reddick from 3 on the basketball courts.","Thank you for reconsidering my application. MHACKS was a really pivotal experience to help me see the immense value V1 provides. Thanks to the reccommendations of Pranay to join the club, I was aware of such an amazing opportunity. I understand the applicant pool is tough and that each individual is qualified in their own right. I hope that I have shown growth since my premature fall application. However, if I have not, then I will come back the next cohort application round even more developed and with a stronger conviction for why V1 is the place for me."

The thrill of experiencing flight through a drone I built from scratch is difficult to describe, but it encapsulates why I am so passionate about building personal projects: the exhilaration of the breakthrough. It all started with my first personal computer – I was obsessed with understanding how each component fit together. From there, it only grew. My racing quadcopters took my project building skills to the next level requiring both hardware and software development. Next, I took on amateur radio. My desire to understand the complicated physics concepts drove me to get my certification. Next, I built my 90 foot antenna and was able to reach Northern Pennsylvania from San Francisco using a station of my own design.","This summer, I co-developed a social media app called JoinMe. JoinMe matches people with activities (e.g., surfing, hiking, crossword solving, etc.) in an attempt to help people meet and make new friends. This app took much more development than I originally expected. It took a considerable amount of time beyond the technical aspects– mapping out the UI, visibility into the seed-stage funding, and strategizing on how to publicize the app. Now that it is up and running, the app has nearly 400 users and is growing consistently. At V1, I hope to continue starting and building products like this but at an even more competitive level. As an entrepreneur, I am curious about the intersection of innovation and business. V1 is the perfect opportunity for me, a builder, to collaborate with like minded individuals to gain both hands-on experience as well as soft skills. Because I'm studying both electrical engineering and computer science, I will provide perspectives in both hardware and software whereas I hope to work with those who have a different background. I am eager to be surrounded by those who are equally ambitious and interested in developing the world around them.","I am a massive sneakerhead with 20 different pairs of Jordans!",""

During my time there, I managed 30 hour work weeks, 22 credit semesters, and the exhaustive transfer application to the University of Michigan. Furthermore, I dedicated the (very little) free time I had to self-taught coding projects, eventually reaching an intermediate level of Python, Javascript, HTML, and CSS. This experience created a strong work ethic and time management skills, while also providing a passion for coding and problem solving. Using these skills, I decided to solve a problem that troubled me for some time. 

Throughout high school and into early college, I didn't know what anime to watch. Although family and friends provided recommendations, I wanted something that was more personalized. Motivated to solve this, I harnessed my skills to create a program using Python’s web scraping and machine learning libraries. Overcoming challenges such as limited requests and random My Anime List URL labeling, I created a recommendation model. This project combined my passion for anime with coding, which now provides me with suggestions, and will soon evolve into a web app that offers recommendations to others as well.
","Although I attend the University of Michigan now, my experience at a community college and a lack of clubs and professional resources set me back a year compared to my current cohorts. As a result, I have yet to find any positions related to software development, and my personal coding experiences only contribute so much to my learning. Despite my lack of experience with developing, I will continue improving to compete on the same level as my peers now. I believe this drive given the setbacks faced at my previous institution will help V1 create the hardworking, high-growth cohort they are searching for. This, combined with V1's commitment to mentorship, is the first step into professional development and my career as a whole. I will use the skills and knowledge learned in V1 to pursue my passion for creating further, while also contributing to V1 as an individual. ","I can fold my ear!

But at MHacks, seeing the different types of projects that others were working on, like a group working on a motion-tracked Subway Surfers and seeing Warp demo their AI-powered Terminal inspired me and my partners to build a cool project for MHacks that utilized AI and data processing to maximize interview performances for hopeful jobseekers, which led to us winning an award. This project and attending the workshops at MHacks got me interested in entrepreneurship as I saw how open the possibilities are, as any cool idea can be made into something much bigger given the time and care. I am very passionate about software development and incorporating new developments such as machine learning and robotics into modern-day problems, and I see entrepreneurship going hand-in-hand with that interest. I hope that throughout my time at UMich, I can take advantage of all the opportunities to connect with other builders and make my own projects that have the potential to impact others.","I am interested in V1 because of the group's dedication in being involvement in the success of it's members. For instance, when talking to Keval at the V1 Kickoff, I was impressed at how there was this team environment not only consisting of people in V1 but V1 alumni and startups affiliated with V1 that helped turn his idea of a way to collect drink tabs at bars into a real-world project that is being implemented at some bars already. I hope to gain this type of selfless community that is willing to build and willing to take risks while also having a fun time doing so, and as I become into a better builder and entrepreneur, I would love to give my ideas and skills to the club and build amazing projects with others in the cohort. ","A fun fact about myself is that I still game on my Xbox 360. I got it in 2011 as a birthday gift, and it's older than some high schoolers at this point, but it is still a big part of my childhood and I get a lot of enjoyment out of playing old games like Forza Motorsport 4, FIFA 12, and NBA 2K13.",

I'm a strong believer that knowledge is most powerful when it's shared, and my work is a reflection of this mentality.

My first significant project was a generator for chess opening trees (https://albonwu.com/projects/visualize-eco). That is, chess openings usually have many variations (which themselves have variations), making it difficult to comprehend the magnitude of opening theory. In this project, I generated opening trees for two well-known openings and open-sourced my code.

Next, in response to a request from a friend studying chemistry, I created the open-source Leitmotifs (https://leitmotifs.vercel.app/), a website for learning flashcards using the spaced repetition Leitner system. This was my first major full-stack project and perhaps my magnum opus (thus far) of web development.

Finally, my ongoing project. I type notes (of high enough quality to sell, I have been told) for my courses and post them on my website (https://albonwu.com/writing). I'm just as passionate as ever about building infrastructure and resources to reliably provide quality information to the world.","V1 strikes me as a very results-oriented yet supportive organization. I've seen the process of planning the Startup Fair (hi Brian and Kevin, if you're reading), and it seems like no matter how much more work remains, everything manages to fall into place in the nick of time. It's this synergy and flow that interests me about V1 because it reflects exactly the approach I take to software engineering.

Conversely, because I recognize the importance of this culture, I am willing and ready to contribute my technical background and passion for technology to projects at V1. I have experience in everything from research to full-stack engineering, both of which involved working tightly with a team to ensure correct and efficient completion of deliverables. I hope to transfer this skillset to V1 and elevate the organization's work in technology and entrepreneurship.","I can recite 100 digits of pi","I consider myself very adaptable; my background is in applied machine learning research, but I recently moved to software engineering.

This meant I had about a month to build an app from scratch. The problem: I was in the middle of taking (not even finished with) my very first coding class. I didn't let my inexperience stop me though. I did a lot of independent research, asked my coding teacher for advice, and pestered my friends to help test it. The final project was relatively simple--it was called ""Paws to Learn"" (aka Pause to Learn), and it taught users to recognize animal body language as well as used machine learning to recognize animal breeds. To my surprise, I won the Challenge in my district! However, it wasn't the excitement of winning that led me to pursue CS, but rather the thrill I got from materializing my years of knowledge from volunteering at the animal shelter to make something that would impact others. It reminded me of my experiences making pieces for writing and art contests growing up, and I fell in love with this new type of ""building"" something, using both my creative and technical sides, to tell a story and demonstrate my passions.
","I became interested in V1 after a member at Winterfest gave me an enthusiastic spiel about the club, and I realized this was an opportunity I needed to take advantage of. I've been looking for a technology-focused community ever since I entered college, especially one centered around helping its members grow, because I still feel relatively new to CS, and I wanted a supportive space where I could grow professionally. I didn't just want to take the required programming classes and call it a day--I also wanted to challenge myself outside of school, and honestly just get the chance to build something really cool. I hope that in V1, I'll have the chance to not just work in an amazing collaborative tech setting, but also get advice from the community, learn skills applicable to the job industry, and connect with the incredible members of V1.

It was a Lego Creator 3-in-1 set, which meant you could build one of three different designs depending on whichever one floated your boat. This taught me two things at an early age; 1) From pieces seemingly insignificant by themselves, you could create something extraordinary and 2) You are only limited by your imagination for the things you can create. That’s why I love being a builder. I know that whenever I encounter a problem, I can build a solution with the skills I have harnessed and developed throughout the years. In high school, my robotics team had the problem of meeting delays as there was always a long line of people trying to sign in. I fixed this issue by creating an attendance software powered by facial recognition to streamline the attendance process. It not only accelerated the sign in process, but also provided a new level of security as people could not simply sign in for their absent friends anymore. At V1, I am excited to continue this journey with its dynamic group of motivated builders.","With both parents in the computer science industry, I understand that professional connections in tech are relatively unimportant compared to those in business. Yet, what attracts me the most to V1 is the people. I became friends with Meghna through mutual interests long before she joined V1. I met Johnathan at a party and have grown closer as friends ever since. These organic friendships testify to me that I will enjoy surrounding myself with members of the V1 community. During the Open House, I was inspired by Dev’s and Rishab’s entrepreneurship spirit and passion. Having been the sole contributor for far too many group projects, I am certain that V1 will provide me with the opposite experience.

However, I had never explored bioinformatics before. With no clue where to start on my very first solo project, I felt extremely unprepared. As I researched, though, I learned where my interests truly lied. I learned to narrow the scope of my project, and I discovered the application that excited me the most: I wanted to design a simplified Python program that identified protein properties, such as 3D structure, by comparing 30 different markers to a single protein amino acid sequence. Through this, I could identify which alignment of the markers relative to the proteins produced the greatest match. My program was able to quantify the number of errors in protein matching and indicate the exact location of the errors.

This project jump-started my eager love for the applications of data science in healthcare, and it taught me that I have the dedication, patience, and ability to explore these applications. I will continue to use the same dedication as I explore my place in the world of data science.","I hope to join V1 because the community is centered on comprehensive skill enhancement, meaningful collaboration, and diving in, head first, into the world of entrepreneurship.

However, growing up in a rural Alabama town, I didn’t have much of a chance to express my culture and spread it. I felt that there was a lack of importance placed around educating oneself on others’ cultures. Therefore, me and my friend decided to create an Asian Cultural Association at our school. Within the club, we promoted multiple initiatives to educate others about Asian cultures. We organized education sessions which involved an individual speaking about their country as people listened. At these sessions, we promoted further involvement with cultures through the sharing of cultural food and videos/movies. As the year progressed, these sessions began to draw a crowd. At the end of the year, we hosted an event that attracted around 1,000 people. I would have never imagined that the club would make it that far, yet, there we were. With the money raised from the event, we reached out to local Asian churches/temples to provide volunteering opportunities for club members. Therefore, through the club, I’m glad to have opened up a gateway for personal expression while having a positive impact on my local community.","Attending the V1 startup fair last semester made me realize the true professional value of the club.

I always loved creating things from my experience in robotics, and, as schools nationwide shut down, an opportunity arose for me to check off a bucket list item: making a mobile app. I started by researching what to learn. Though I had Java experience in a robotics setting, I soon realized how different mobile app development was. After researching different frameworks, I began learning how to make mobile apps with React Native. Beginning with a Pomodoro timer, I eventually gained the confidence to explore ML, starting by integrating APIs. This curiosity led me to learn how to build my own APIs with Flask and Express.js. 

As the months passed, I eventually ran out of ideas until I received an email from MLH regarding a hackathon where I could win a Google Home, a surreal thought at the time. Though I was initially motivated by greed, by participating in a hackathon, I began making more meaningful projects, varying from a wildfire alert app to a gunshot detection alarm. I now build hoping to, one day, deploy my own solution and help solve one of the countless problems society faces today.","Since high school, I have found joy in creating things. From participating in hackathons, I realized the potential the prototypes I developed had to make a real impact. My math problem-solving app could have improved accessibility in education. Yes, I did learn a lot in the process, but I never had the knowledge to act on my ideas, which I hope to obtain through V1.
I realized V1 was created not for competition but rather for a community of innovators looking to grow. Everyone enjoyed spending time together without a purpose in mind and club to sell. By joining the community, I hope to leverage the mentorship program to launch my own project ideas into the public with insight into funding, marketing and more.

In return, I aim to contribute by helping members in ideation, answering questions about entrepreneurship, and offering guidance on full stack mobile and web app practices.","When I was younger, I was a big Cars fan, so I convinced my parents to buy me a Lightning McQueen bed.

Before people realize the article above is fake, it’s probably already received 2 million views on social media. This headline could easily be from an Artificial Intelligence model trained to fabricate attention-grabbing headlines.

As an avid high school debater, I’ve always been interested in misinformation’s influence on individuals and —  by extension — societies. Beneath this issue lies a crucial question: how do we find the truth in a story? 

I explored this question with a researcher in London by building an algorithm that classifies misinformation in internet articles based on patterns drawn from over 17,000 articles. As I built the algorithm, the questions kept multiplying. How should we distinguish between similar information presented in different ways? Were articles that spelled out every excruciating detail more reliable than briefer ones that elided the facts to tell the story? 

By the end, my model classified articles with 98% accuracy. Despite the complications, this project showed me that I can use technology as a solution to our biggest problems—even ones that technology itself has created. One day, I hope to see this headline:

Over time, I’ve developed a strong interest in the education sector, particularly in light of the confining academic toxicity that has plagued my high school life. I discovered that peer pressure was largely to blame; therefore, I joined a team of developers, designers, artists, and creators to establish Helivox, a database where you can find the opportunities that meet your independent interests and aspirations. 

In a new chapter, I’ve dipped my toes into a much more creative, entrepreneurial side of software development.

While juggling school, I noticed lots of folks, myself included, needed someone to talk to about mental health stuff. That's when I had a lightbulb moment – why not create a website that connects people with mentors who can just listen?

With little cash, I dove into learning how to make websites, tapped into my techy friends, and after a bunch of late nights, I launched the site. People loved it! Soon, mentors from all walks of life were helping out, making the whole thing even more awesome.

Sure, we hit some bumps – website glitches, no funds – but I stuck with it. The site not only helped folks with their mental health but also built a supportive community.

The monstrous hits, the electric plays, the miracles? It was my dream to play when I grew older as well. Of course, as I grew, I realized that this dream isn't realistic. However, that doesn't mean that my passion for the game disappeared.
In fact, the opposite occurred. I became obsessed with getting involved with football indirectly. Specifically, in senior year when a couple of friends and I came together. The idea was to design and build a prototype for a helmet which would reduce the risk of concussions. Additionally, it would have a device which would return the speed of the helmet. If the speed reached concussion risk levels, a noise would sound and the player would be taken out of the game. 
I also built at the University of Michigan. Through a club I joined, Wolverine Sports Analytics, I helped create a program that would analyze team stats and predict outcomes. 
It also shouldn’t go without mentioning that I continue to love Legos, and I designed/3D printed a model for a statue that could be constructed on campus.","While I do have experience in building, I realized that I am, at the end of the day, limited in how much I know. While I could go online and figure things out myself, there is something non-replicable about getting help from a mentor, let alone one from V1. Speaking to some of the board members, I realized how special V1 is. I feel as if the mentors I would be assigned with from V1 could take my passions to the next level, induce a new spark in me, and get me motivated to take action on more ideas that I may have. That isn't all however. The community at V1 seems impossible to find elsewhere and is something that I have never experienced before. Being a part of a cohort and making this experience more personal is something that I would absolutely love.
","I have two missing teeth. They weren't knocked out or anything, they just didn't grow back in.","The University of Michigan experience has been out of this world so far. I met the most amazing people and learned so much. However, I know there is so much more to explore. I know that being a part of this semester's cohort will help me explore and make amazing memories, which is why I am so excited for this opportunity."

In the summer of 2022, I did research at Stony Brook University, where I used machine learning to predict if someone would achieve remission from depression. I then presented my methodology at the Center for Statistical Practice Annual Conference in San Francisco. Apart from machine learning, I’ve also done projects that used CNNs to detect AI-generated faces and skin cancer. Recently, I’ve been into sentiment analysis using NLP. I finished a project that categorized Twitter posts as positive or negative and another that analyzed discord messages. 

I got into backend development after my internship at a startup called Endgrate last summer. I worked with connecting APIs to their central database using Python. In addition, I’ve worked with frameworks such as Flask and Django for some of my own projects. During MHacks, I also learned about Firebase and Flutter to create an app. While I have experience with backend, I still prefer AI and all the possibilities that can be created with it.","If you could combine all the water in the world, it would form an ocean. Likewise, if you took all the minds in the world and put them together, you could form a giant sea of knowledge. Such is the concept behind the best resource for innovation: collaborative teams. 

This is also the place where I thrive. I relish talking to new people bouncing ideas off their differing perspectives. I can also contribute my unique perspectives on various topics and ideas here. Furthermore, as a developer, I always seek opportunities to improve my skills and solve problems. V1 is the perfect place to do so while building new products and ideas that could be revolutionary. I’m excited to collaborate with the bright minds at V1 to generate innovative ideas while contributing to building said ideas through my expertise in AI and backend development.

This involved lots of planning, testing, and building, all critical steps in the process of creation. The event honed my problem-solving skills and taught me to persevere even if Although Science Olympiad was mainly focused on science, it fueled my interest in technology and engineering.

I noticed that the number of girls on the softball team kept declining every year, so I reached out. The director instead pointed me in the direction of coaching for the middle school team. So for 2 years, I was the assistant coach for the middle school softball team, organizing and leading practices. I recruited one of my teammates to join me as a coach in senior year, so after I graduated, I knew there would be another assistant coach to help the middle school team continue. I loved seeing the girls on the team improve over the season and listen to my advice—I never believed I could have an meaningful impact like this.

I started from programming my robots to follow lines to using ROS2 and LiDAR to command Oru, a tank-like robot, to follow a person through my internship. This had yet fulfilled my pleasure.

I found myself motivated when I volunteered to teach the blind children and saw the challenges they faced everyday. It was then I realized the real meaning of invention. With the strong desire to improve their lives, I designed an assistive device, aiming to aid them to walk cane-free. My goal expanded when I joined a bootcamp, learning about entrepreneurship, where I created a “protective belt” for the elderly to protect them from injury when falling. With a team, the idea was developed into a prototype with marketing strategy. My passion to become a founder was crystalized when my invention was selected as one of the three to pitch to real investors. 

With the guidance, opportunities, and network V1 provides, I believe that together we could create an inclusive community through inventions. This is my version of magic.
","As an international student, finding both a like-minded community and a place to give life to my ideas is challenging, but V1 offers both. V1 is such a creative community where people come together and grind out projects purely for the love of creating.

I believe in an experiential learning approach. V1 provides this opportunity for me to learn both programming and entrepreneurship skills while creating something meaningful. Being involved with such passionate experts with resources and networks opens up countless experiences, establishing a solid foundation to my path on becoming a founder. 

My unique Thai culture and diverse background will be a great addition to the group, while my passion to help the disabled brings in a unique set of eyes when addressing problems. I am certain on my path to create successful startups of adaptive devices, and become another mentor for the next generation of builders at V1.

I was not building any tangible product, and I found myself wishing I could make something to share with others. Such was the birth of Wordstems, my very own word game, built with self-taught Javascript and HTML/CSS (thank you, Youtube). This, I loved. I found myself eager to add features my friends suggested (confetti for long words, generate other possible answers at the end, add a cat to the home screen) and filled with pride anytime someone would send me their new high score.

Other times, my builds adapt to my employment. For instance, when I interned at Anchorage Economic Development Corporation, I designed and published multiple public reports. I also drafted an EDA grant application, which uses industry data collected by TIP Strategies to detect and solve issues afflicting my city’s economy. Another build worth mentioning is my submission to the EECS 183 final project, which asked teams to manage three elevators in a way that minimizes dissatisfaction levels among NPCs who are waiting. As the team leader, I encouraged my group to pursue a challenging, high-level implementation. Thus, our algorithm stood out by determining whether elevators already in motion are closest to the most dissatisfied individuals, in which case we should send idling elevators to the second-most dissatisfied people. Devising a creative solution to this unique challenge was exhilarating, and it sparked my interest in Computer Science.","Creative projects are what I enjoy most. Nothing is more exhilarating than building something new. As of late, my creative ambitions have bent toward software development and entrepreneurship. However, my knowledge of those fields is incomplete. Thus, V1 will provide the perfect avenue to chase my passions because I’ll be able to achieve proficiency with UX design while improving my pre-existing programming skills. In short, V1 will give me all of the resources I need to see my creative visions to fruition. Furthermore, V1 stands to benefit from my tenacity. I’m a hard worker who refuses to be held back by any lack of experience whatsoever. As such, I earned 100% on my first EECS 183 exam and an A+ in the course (>100% cumulative) with no prior coding experience. Finally, I’m eager to join V1’s vibrant community, where I’ll befriend other creative, ambitious people who share my interests.

I am deeply passionate about the intersection of computer science and real-world problem-solving. In various projects, I've applied my skills to develop unique real-world programs, including a rocket simulation  in C++ that optimized fuel consumption for specific altitudes. I’ve also created many projects related to gathering data, such as computing all relevant statistics for a data set, as I am also interested in the field of data science and statistics. 
Specifically, I am drawn to entrepreneurship due to its dynamic nature and the limitless opportunities it presents for innovation and growth. The prospect of creating something from scratch, bringing an idea to life, and navigating the challenges of building and scaling a business is incredibly appealing to me. Entrepreneurship allows for autonomy and the ability to make a meaningful impact on industries and communities. The constant need for adaptability, problem-solving, and strategic thinking fuels my passion for this field. Last semester, in my E-commerce Entrepreneurship class was when I fully dove into the concepts and skills in entrepreneurship and created an online shop for vintage university clothing. ","I am eager to be a part of V1 because it aligns with my passion for innovation and collaborative growth. V1's commitment to fostering a community of ambitious student builders, spanning various disciplines like engineering, design, and entrepreneurship, resonates with my belief in the power of interdisciplinary collaboration. Being a part of the V1 Michigan community, I hope to contribute my skills and creativity to ambitious projects, collaborating with like-minded individuals to bring innovative ideas to life. I am eager to gain not only valuable experiences and connections but also the chance to make a meaningful impact within a community that shares my drive for achieving great things collectively. V1 Michigan's focus on building, networking, and creating the next generation of products aligns perfectly with my aspirations, and I am enthusiastic about the prospect of growing and learning alongside fellow driven individuals in this dynamic environment.","I started a robotics company in high school that serves at 5 elementary schools today!","Member Referral: Keval Botadra"

This inspired us to take action. As eight high school students without business experience, I recognized the need for guidance and reached out to local business owners and university mentors to create a structured plan. Our first three weeks were dedicated to building the foundation of our company. We developed our website, designed products, and established connections for materials. 

We immediately ran into a problem. As we began to sell products, we weren’t reaching our sales goals, so we ventured into marketing, launching Instagram and TikTok accounts, and actively engaging in conferences to boost our brand's presence. 

I further suggested we conduct research in various schools to identify designs that resonated with students, our target market. This feedback informed our product releases, amplifying our impact within the community.

Through careful planning, mentorship, and unwavering dedication, we transformed our vision into a reality. Our clothing brand not only flourished but also evolved into a potent platform for promoting mental health awareness and support. Our journey highlights the power of collective action and mentorship in turning aspirations into a tangible force for positive change.
","From the moment I started talking to V1 members at Winterfest, I felt an unparalleled sense of community, and this feeling has never faltered. Apart from feeling more immersed in the V1 community, I have also gotten to hear about the professional development of some of the members. I now know that through V1, I will be able to develop various soft and technical skills.

I cannot get over the family that is V1. From Suhaas explaining how outputting “hello world” helped him pass his OA, to dapping him up by Joe’s, these experiences have made me realize that V1 will support my professional growth, and give me a community I can call home. If given the opportunity, I will mentor new recruits like Suhaas has done for me. Although I have yet to join V1, I feel like I have already been accepted as a member of the family.

Before going to college I frequently worked at my mother's IT consulting company, ACS Consultancy. I mostly stuck to doing accounting and payroll, but one day I decided to check out the company website and noticed that it was really rough. (Old website: https://acsconsultancyny.com/) The grammar was way off and the overall design of it was just unappealing. Knowing how important a company's website is, I decided that I'd revamp the website for the business. With a little bit of help, I started work on the company's new website, hosted on the Amazon Web Service.(New website: https://www.acsincny.com/). I wrote descriptions and did graphic design on much of the website, implemented new sections and ideas that the old website did not have, and helped write the code on python for the website. The results have been extraordinary for our company's growth, making it extremely simple for anyone to apply to the company. Most importantly, it taught me that my ideas could really create a positive change, and inspired me to work on more projects for the company.","I hope that V1 would give me the opportunity to implement my ideas into actual projects. I'm constantly amazed by what I hear about the club and the projects people work on, such as the AI tool that helps people fix their appliances. Working in my mother's business, I was always looking for problems and ways to solve them. I found an error in the way we calculate payroll and saved the business over 1,000 dollars, I helped my mom create incentives for her workers in order to produce higher quality work, and I helped revamp and redesign the company's website. Whether business or tech, I'm constantly looking for ways to improve whatever I'm working on at the moment, and I feel like V1 really shares that spirit. At V1, I would hope to contribute everything I can to make a finished product I can be proud of.","As a kid, my favorite hobby was building robots.

That was the day Russian troops crossed the border. All I could do was watch in horror as the places where my parents had built their lives were suddenly threatened. Determined to help my fellow Ukrainians, I started contemplating how to use my skills and resources to help. 

From a cousin, I learned Ukraine was in desperate need of medical equipment. Throughout the pandemic, I had volunteered to 3D print face shields—and I wondered if I could apply the same, crowdsourced model to help Ukraine. By myself, however, I wouldn’t be able to print enough of anything to meet the deficit. I had to rally the support of the 3D-printing community.

I branded the effort Adapt3D, and I was soon humbled by an incredible outpouring of support. There was Sergey, the CEO of a company that distributed our braces in Ukraine, Yann, a French medical device designer, and, most importantly, every single 3D-printing enthusiast across 3 continents who ran their printers around-the-clock to help us ship 4200 finger, wrist, and palm braces to Ukraine.

Since then, I’ve still enjoyed arranging music for performances, but I have also branched out into other forms of creating.

The only path I assuredly wanted to pursue was one that lifted people up. This inspired me to join M-HEAL where we are building infant bassinets to fight neonatal hypothermia abroad and join MedLaunch to build a pill tracking app to ease the burden of medical adherence for dementia patients, an issue I have had to witness firsthand. These experiences taught me what I’m capable of building myself, and empowered me to craft my own projects. Thus over summer break, I worked on building an AI powered malaria identifier and now I’ve decided to dedicate myself to web development to open the door of possible ideas I can manifest. After burying myself in full-stack development over winter break, I’ve begun working on my current project, which is a family memories app. This will allow users to maintain a record of how their families faced life, through blogs, family profiles, and various methods to store images and videos. I am excited to make an impact with my projects, and use the community of V1 to take them to new heights. ","V1 ‘s uplifting community and their relentless passion for innovation aligns strongly with the values of the person I want to develop myself into. I am a strong believer that I am the average of the people I surround myself with, and immersing myself in this community of people who not only seize life by the reins, but also are dedicated to bringing others up through sharing their wisdom, is a mentality I want to further cultivate. On the flip side, I’m passionate about providing mentorship as I believe that knowledge that goes unshared is a waste, and I’d love to save someone from a misfortune I faced, by sharing my experience. Lastly, building products that can make a difference is what drives me, and I hope to collaborate with my peers in V1 and take advantage of the vast array of resources to bring my ideas to fruition. ","I love going on nighttime drives, but I often get lost in thought while listening to music, so one time, after a particularly bopping run of Baby Keem, I found myself crossing the “Welcome To Ohio” sign. The worst part is getting lost happens often enough that I’ve set a rule for myself to not use GPS to get home, so it took a very disorienting 3 hours to hobble my way back.

I am involved in SLED Research Lab, and last semester, my research mentor and I addressed: Create a user model to predict user’s mental state through their previous interactions and enhance user experience with AI assistance for future steps by tailoring responses to best accommodate user’s emotional and mental dispositions. Our procedure involved extending our multimodal benchmark dataset and investigating whether LLMs can accurately interpret underlying user states. I wrote a Python script to concatenate and format user and instructor dialogue with Pandas and datetime libraries. We conducted a pairwise Pearson correlation analysis, examined user mental state consistency, and compared F1, precision, and recall of model’s predictions with our annotations. Users exhibit different levels of consistency and significant improvements are needed for LLMs to understand several categories, opening opportunities for improving multimodal foundation models to offer task guidance.

At Connect Me, we provided free tutoring to underprivileged students around the nation via Zoom, and, being a remote organization, we had several issues organizing all our tutor and student information in a single database. Through this issue, I became very interested in the logistics of the organization, and worked to build a database on the backend of our website, which included all student and tutor information, split into two databases. The project turned out to be a success, and it rapidly improved our matching processes as we could easily extract necessary information, such as timings and subject interest, to pair tutors with students.

I did the same for DineSure: I created customized prototypes for each restaurant—as if we had already formed a partnership—until we got our first client: Anna’s Taqueria!

I’ve realized when it comes time to share a product, voice an opinion, or express one’s eccentricities to the world, a basic principle holds: there’s no harm in trying to overturn “no.”

We were aiming to create an affordable cold cap that would allow patients to keep their hair during chemotherapy. We started out just using ice packs and putting them together with tape, but we eventually decided to develop something more complicated. After fundraising and contacting experts in the field we finally found someone to help us make the product. We went up to Indiana to see their plastics factory and understand how they designed the cold caps. A few months after going to the factory our prototype was finally ready. Having our work culminate into a physical product and a patent felt so good. The ultimate goal of these cold caps was to bring them to market, and to keep them affordable.

These cold caps would be cheaper than the ones offered in the hospital and would be a one-time purchase instead of paying to use them. I dream to one day be able to bring my product to market and make sure no one ever has to lose their hair.
","Working a late night in the Shapiro Library I couldn't help but overhear a conversation happening one desk away from me. Someone was describing a community of entrepreneurs who were all driven and wanted to build things. This greatly excited me, never before had I heard of a community whose goals aligned so much with mine. I couldn't help but approach the people having the conversation and ask them about it. This is when I found out about V1. That night I went home the most excited I’d ever been in my short college career, I couldn't wait to apply and hopefully join the community.  

Through its Product Studio program V1 would undoubtedly help me become a better builder. It would give me invaluable experience to achieve my lifelong dream of one day being a founder. Being in such a community would allow me to push myself while also pushing those around me to truly grow.

Over my childhood summers, I would craft random contraptions from household materials—hot glue, cardboard, and a pencil transformed into a fully functioning combination lock. Trips to RadioShack led to rudimentary electric 'cars.' These afternoons marked the start of a lifelong journey.

As I matured, my creative pursuits evolved into more techy projects. Developing ML models to diagnose skin cancers from lesion images; Crafting a set of cheats for classic GamePigeon games; and Building a (mediocre) chess engine from scratch. Currently, I'm learning Unity to simulate the motion of slime molds and ant colonies, simply because it is beautiful and can be used to solve fascinating optimization problems. 
Despite my numerous projects, they have always lacked a definitive end goal or exit strategy — they were born purely out of fascination.

Now, I find myself yearning to transform this creative drive into something substantial. V1, with its focus on the startup culture, seems like the perfect avenue to gain those vital skills and tools. It's not just about creating; it's about creating for a purpose. I believe V1 is the catalyst I need to propel my creative endeavors into something meaningful and impactful.
","V1 provides a unique opportunity to dive into the startup world. It gives a window into an exciting and lucrative space surrounding the next-big-things along with the tools to leverage that information to create an impact.

The organization is a hub of talent, and I'm excited about connecting and learning from my peers. It will be valuable to bounce ideas off each other, receive advice, hear from successful entrepreneurs, and help bring each other's ideas to fruition.

V1 fosters a sociable, supportive, community environment where members root for each other's success in their endeavors. During a conversation with a current member, I was told that ""you get what you put in, if you're willing to hustle, then V1 will hustle for you"". 

As a developer, project creator, and self-proclaimed hustler, that attitude and hunger resonates deeply with me. Given the opportunity, I hope to grow and help others grow in the V1 community.

As a computer science and business dual degree, my explicit goal is to combine software experience with technical business skills to enter the startup space, building my own products and company throughout my career in order to drive this aspiring level of impact.
        An experience which solidified this career path is my internship from this past summer where my team worked to develop a ride-sharing app for a South African startup, Karpool. Over a six week development timeline I was able to take empty frontend and backend GitHub repositories and deliver a functional prototype with key features developed. Future users will be able to register, organize travel routes, pay finely calculated services fees, and message in real time because of my team’s and I’s efforts. I gained meaningful technical skills and industry experience, however the process showed me that if done correctly I can realize long-term visions through projects like these.

","        I am excited at the opportunity to join V1’s Product Studio team with my potential cohort as I have ideas for real-world applications, and I am determined to bring them to life to create impact.
	For example, I am highly eager to begin development on a platform which functions similar to Atlas, which maps student course schedules with elegant UI, but integrates Snapchat API to create a social network. My vision for this product is to create a campus community where students can seamlessly align their class schedules with close friends and connect with other students in their classes.
	With ideas like this kept closely in mind, I approach V1 with the specific purpose of finding a team of driven builders who can help ideas like these–applications with potential to create impact but are too intricate to feasibly develop alone–to life by deploying them to the world.

As such, I'm not tied to any specific technology – I use various programming languages, services, and frameworks to address issues. Since high school, I've been involved in different projects for both personal learning and team collaboration. For instance, in my final year of high school, I developed a Python auctioning system using Tkinter for a class project.
Beyond projects in classes like EECS 280 and 281, I've worked on some interesting projects such as creating Google extensions for ad-blocking, bookmarking YouTube URLs in a Notion Database, and time tracking for websites. I've also dived into building Discord bots using Discord.py, leveraging Google Sheets as a database to display trivia/quiz questions.
Recently, I've delved into full-stack web development, learning Node.js (Express.js), Flask, and React.

How planes fly? Or how Olive Garden provides “unlimited” breadsticks? Questions like these float around in my head every moment of the day. My curiosity drives me to seek out answers in almost every facet of life. My parents think it’s annoying, but I think it is a fundamental part of me. 

My curiosity drives me to find solutions to problems that were never mine or never obvious in any way. In my robotics team in high school, I asked “Why can’t we change the drivetrain module assembly to elevate the robot by another 2 inches?” I was questioning the manufacturer's assembly instructions on a well established Omnidirectional drivetrain. 

Surprisingly no one had considered it before.  It felt ridiculous but I CADed through our concerns. I showed the stress analytics from numerous scenarios and assured everyone ""it can work"". 

This is how I approached the design and strategy, creating a robot that questioned the norm and became the best in our team's history. 

Even though it’s a nuisance to my parents, it drives me. And one day, I will ask a question that will help millions. Until then, I’ll keep asking away.","You know that feeling when you walk into a room and receive a standing ovation? Yeah me neither, but I imagine that’s the feeling I would get at V1 by using business and CS to innovate and deliver a product that makes people happy. 

Coming from an engineering background, I know it is easy to get caught up in the technicals. “We need X to move here,” or “No we can’t write code like that”. These things are okay purely in the engineering world, but at the end of the day, writing perfect code won’t leave a lasting impact. 

I want to join a group of like-minded people who are passionate about creating technically innovative products that address real world needs. The projects at Demo Day convinced me that V1 is the best place to do that. Meeting members like Zain who advised my coursework attracts me to V1 more.","My top bucket list item is to photograph all 7 ancient wonders of the world. I’m currently at 2/7 with visits to Chichén Itzá and Taj Mahal.","I’ll keep it short.

Meghna sold me on V1 in 2 minutes when she told me exactly how she was able to learn and apply her skills within V1. I could hear the passion in her voice, and I hope I can deliver that same energy in the future."

When it comes to building games, you can basically create anything you want. As long as it's entertaining and interesting, it doesn’t matter how absurd the idea is. Additionally, video games can take on any format. For example, the first application I made was a recreation of dominoes in the text-console. Since then, I’ve pursued a lot more projects like a tower defense game and a 3D, first-person, solve-the-maze game with custom graphics. While these have been some of the most challenging projects I’ve done, each project has helped me develop a diverse set of skills that not only apply to programming like polymorphism and raycasting, but skills that also translate to the real world like time-management and goal setting. Truth be told, there have been a lot of times I’ve wanted to drop a project because of how tedious or difficult it was; however, every time I finish developing it, I’m reminded of why I’m passionate about what I do: seeing the world you built come to life is a feeling like no other. ","People say that your community has a profound effect on who you are and what you become. When it comes to community, V1 is one of the most unique clubs that I have ever seen.

When it comes to my career, I aspire to embody V1’s values, so that I can be proactive and capitalize my ideas while turning them into a reality. In return, I’d like to share my own ideas with the club and contribute to the inventive atmosphere that V1 has fostered. For example, I have an AI cooking app that I’d like to build because it would be helpful to learn how to cook. Not only would that help me, but through V1’s large-scale resources, could aid a culinarily-challenged community on a bigger level.","

That specifically, is where my passion for entrepreneurship began. I have always loved reading, but in this new era of technology, books seem to be dying out, something that novels such as 1984 have warned against. My biggest career goal is to combine history-filled books with the blank website domains of the future.

My favorite tech project was my senior project, because of its collaborative and ambitious nature. Due to the large team size and our operational ASV requiring so many different skills, members were responsible for regular reports so that we were constantly aware of team progress and able to each integrate our subsection of work into the robot. That also meant I felt personal responsibility for the team vision, and is what drove me to independently explore the field of computer vision. I learned how to train weights from datasets with thousands of images and use those weights to perform CV with an object detection system. Another tech-related project I have worked on was developing a Python simulator to regulate time-transfer, which taught me how to work with linux and model physics equations using code. Recently, I  helped build an app using the Unity Engine based on designs made in Figma and modeled in Blender. 
As for entrepreneurship, I became interested in the space after taking Economics in high school and competing in the Governor’s Challenge. I hope to learn more about using code to predict results in the economy.","I'm enthusiastic about joining V1 because of its vibrant community dedicated to fostering innovation and collaboration.

Aspiring to be a lawyer in high school, I gradually realized that the legal field did not fulfill the three elements I value most in my work: grit, vision, and growth. Thus, I became attracted to entrepreneurship, a career that embodies these aspects. 

Initially, I became interested in machine learning after interning at a biotechnology laboratory, and I subsequently pursued high-level certification through courses taught by Andrew Ng. That summer, I was invited to join GEKOT Inc., a start-up developing city-compliant technologies for electric scooters in partnership with Razor. Currently, I’m working on data visualization and improving the ML model for a sidewalk detection device.

I am most passionate about immersing the user into my products, and I have been learning web and mobile development to allow easy access to even hardware-based solutions in the future. Over winter break, I learned React Native and built a mobile application that can identify plant species and plant diseases just from pictures. Furthermore, I am currently building a new ML-based application using the Spotify API in Swift, as I want to take advantage of the tools and data that iOS offers. ","V1’s cohort program fosters innovation, self-betterment, and vision, and I’m excited to join it to utilize its unparalleled mentorship, resources, and connections to improve upon my skills and to launch a substantial product. I strongly value V1’s tight-knit community as well; I feel that I can bond with like-minded students, who are just as social as they are excited about software and start-ups. 

Like V1’s community, I too want to cultivate a stronger entrepreneurial culture at UMich. Being a CE major, I believe in the limitless potential of embedded systems and that changing an industry will require more than solely hardware or software. V1 does extremely well in the latter, and I hope to expand the community to include hardware enthusiasts. I understand that V1’s current resources/mentors may be more software-oriented, though I would be willing to bring in my own hardware components and connections to kickstart this vision.","I have trained in karate for nearly a decade, and I earned my black belt when I was 14 years old.

While this task was manageable for me, I struggled to watch the senior citizens I volunteered alongside being unable to participate in something they enjoyed due to conditions such as arthritis and back pain. This observation sparked my interest in creating products that can assist those who cannot complete essential tasks in their daily lives.

Shortly after this experience, I found myself immersed in a year-long project with a small group of classmates called the Auto-Raker. Our goal with this product was to automate the raking process for those with physical disabilities. With a budget of $100, we seamlessly combined Home Depot products with electronics and vacuum dynamics to create a functional prototype that could rake and bag leaves with minimal input from the user. At the end of the school year, we presented our project at a small convention with about 100 people in attendance. Even though potential investors did not attend our presentation, developing an elevator pitch and answering technical questions from panelists gave me the confidence to create a product from scratch and get involved in entrepreneurship and the startup scene.
","With my desire to create a product from the ground up, being a member of a cohort in the Product Studio Program would be the ideal environment to facilitate my growth as a creator. Moreover, it would develop my ability to synergize and collaborate on a team with other talented students with different mindsets and perspectives.

From my previous project experiences, my strongest skill in working with a team is my adaptable and open-minded personality. In my prospective cohort at V1, the contribution of my character would be helpful in brainstorming and strategizing during roadblocks throughout the development process. 

Furthermore, the structure of V1 is perfect for builders. Having dedicated time during the semester to design a product I am passionate about would be an excellent way to escape from my schoolwork and de-stress while still actively contributing to something greater than myself.

These are two pieces of media that first sparked my interest in the startup world. However, my experience in the startup world has taught me that developing products was more than scamming business partners out of equity and arguing with your investors. Recently starting work at a top startup developed here at the University of Michigan has nurtured my passion to innovate. I crave for the fast-paced, collaborative environment and the mutual goal of expanding/refining a product into a full-blown business. A significant step in my journey occured last year, when I participated in the Business+Tech Innovation Jam. My team chose to develop a research application with no barriers, empowering anyone and everyone to create real, data-backed studies. I loved working alongside MBA and Computer Science students, eventually formulating an impact-based presentation to attempt to impress the world-class panel of judges. Our team ended up taking home the top prize, that of funding for the venture. Although we ended up deciding to pause our progress, such experiences have not only honed my technical skills, but also deepened my understanding and hunger to leverage the transformative power of accessible technology.","I'm really excited about the prospect of joining V1 at the University of Michigan.

What I hope to bring to V1 is a blend of enthusiasm, a fresh perspective, and a collaborative spirit. I've always believed in the power of sharing ideas and experiences, and I'm eager to contribute my bit, whether it's through brainstorming sessions, project collaborations, or just casual coffee chat discussions.

In return, I'm looking to gain from the diverse experiences and insights of fellow members: the startups they have worked at, the people they have been around, the ideas they are fostering. The chance to connect with like-minded peers, learn from their journeys, and maybe even find mentors is something I value highly. ","I'm from Bettendorf, Iowa.",

Some–like “the future of oil” felt abstract.  But “Do we have a STEM crisis?” felt immediately engaging.

First, I had to figure out what “a STEM Crisis” was. Most of my friends love STEM subjects, so where was the crisis?  I found an answer not online or in class but at my barbershop.

The woman cutting my dense, funky hair told me her daughter was “interested in engineering.” But when I asked about her school’s robotics or STEM programs, she said her school didn’t have any. Maybe this was the STEM crisis?

In the last two years, I’ve been focusing on creating networks to spread free educational resources. I host a weekly robotics camp, and I’m the COO of Spark2Code: an educational organization teaching kids coding. On a global scale, I’ve hosted SpreadLove, an educational hackathon focused on reducing disparities in STEM. We work with more than 100 students and have raised $73,000 in STEM resources.

Perhaps the STEM crisis can be solved one school and one neighborhood at a time, creating more resources, more awareness, and–eventually–more STEM students.","Last summer, when my family visited Hawaii, we drove the 65-mile-long ""Road to Hana."" Although I’ve never liked road trips, this one was different-It was enchanting in an erratic manner. Throughout the journey, the process of uncovering the unknown was captivating-so much so I forgot about our destination.

At V1, rather than focusing on an end-goal, I want to live in the moment to make lifelong experiences and memories. 

Joining a mature organization, I would focus on creating unique tech with my peers that expand beyond projects other clubs are pursuing. By utilizing our speakers and alumni, I would apply my current theoretical knowledge in a practical environment building from the ground up.

Thinking of my experience at V1, I have come to a realization-I am not joining V1 for its prestige. The experiences along the way-with my future peers, employers, and alumni-are what will truly define a fulfilling experience.","I am an aspiring chef!

I pursue entrepreneurship because of this passion for improvement and also because I want to be challenged to think outside-of-the-box and problem-solve societal issues. Over the years, my way of 'building' has included writing pieces about social issues, blogging about wildlife conservation, developing strategies with nonprofits/organizations, and most notably, creating STEM resources to bridge educational gaps in career readiness.

From painting to composing music, these passions have been integral parts of my identity that I hope to translate into a rewarding professional career.

The transition to computer science and technology was less of a shift and more of a natural progression. Like art, coding involves an appreciation for intricate patterns, structures, and sequences, blending creativity with logic. This intersection is evident in my projects which range from digital art to conceptualizing dynamic virtual worlds. I have worked in game engines like Unreal and Unity on a few different projects and games, and I once built a ML doorbell system (like a Ring but with more customizable gimmicky features), but now I hope to move that into a more practical software development environment.

I have always been drawn to the idea of entrepreneurship as it would allow me the freedom to combine technological innovation with the opportunity to explore my artistic skills and creativity.

Therefore, the project I’m most proud of as a builder is the novel manuscript I’ve worked on for almost two years. I’ve engaged in product ideation through my extensive conceptualizations of worldbuilding, narrative structure, and themes. I’ve scoped and defined my product by focusing on the underdeveloped niche of South Asian representation in the market, creating a unique Indian-inspired fantasy that defies stereotypes. Prototyping through drafts and iterative beta reader feedback and producing increasingly refined mockups of the story, my manuscript is now at almost 100,000 words (and counting). My next step is to optimize my product through comprehensive editing, and tackle market viability by securing a literary agent and publishing deal.

I also want to extend my building beyond the realms of storytelling by channeling my passion for language into an app for creative writing development. Throughout my writing process, I’ve found the search for feedback overwhelming, and attitude towards young authors disdainful. I want to create a networking/social app where writers can share their ideas, seek constructive beta reader feedback, and forge meaningful relationships with peers and agents alike.

It was awesome to be a part of that community where so many diverse ideas were developed. I worked on the AFK DJ project with people I met from UMich and MSU and their ideas went in a completely different direction from mine, which made them even more interesting. This was a computer vision project which I never even considered doing. Outside of that, many of the projects I have worked on have been related to machine learning models. For example, last semester on the Michigan Data Science Team, I contributed to a next word prediction model (can be used for finishing search queries, or autofill) which used a neural network an LSTM architecture. I'm also really glad I learned about Streamlit there since it gives a simple Python interface to showcase the complicated work done behind the scenes. This semester, I'm a project lead for a stock market prediction project which I'm really excited to get into. Now seeing how creating a web product isn't out of my realm of possibility combined with the ideation I saw from MHacks convinced opened my entrepreneurial mind.","I believe one of my team members from MHacks (Alison) is a part of V1 and the interactions that I saw between everyone hosting the event showed how tight-knit V1 is. I hope to be a part of that community to make unique friendships and connections with driven peers. It is a motivating group to be around! I also look forward to build on those relationships by using my background to obviously contribute my vision and ideas to projects while helping to develop them. But I also hope to bring that perspective to contribute outside of a building context. For example, this could be through pitching new technologies to consider and voicing my opinion in slack conversations. Or it could just be by bringing my energy to make some memories!","There's a lot of rivers in my hometown, so I really like going river tubing to relax, even though I don't know how to swim.

Some of the projects I’ve built include: HelpNow (2019) - a device that assists visually impaired individuals with detecting nearby obstructions, ReportNow (2019) - a wearable device that allows a person to receive immediate help by sending a text to a loved one with their location, Cupertino Bills (2020) - a website that summarizes complicated City documents, Diabetic Retinopathy Research (2021) - an algorithm that examines the influence of genes linked to comorbidities on the development of DR, AdaptiveVL (2022) - a human emotion detection-based software program for virtual learning, CDST (2022) - a clinical decision/diagnosis support tool, and Abortion Access (2022) - a website for pregnant individuals to explore their options and stay up-to-date about recent legislation.

Outside of personal tech projects, I also love community service–particularly, working with children. Through We Love STEM, I realized how much I enjoyed helping students fall in love with creativity. One of my fondest memories at WLS was Summer 2022 where our team personally got close with our Summer Camp students at a homeless shelter in Oakland.","I once read a quote that said, “Do not fear failure, but rather fear not trying.” 

I feel V1’s mission embodies this statement. Many people have extraordinary ideas but never pursue them because it “seems impossible”. However, I believe being in an inspiring community like V1 surrounded by other innovators would encourage people to let the excitement of reaching success–rather than fear of failure–motivate them to make their ideas reality.

I hope to contribute to this community by utilizing my skills in proactiveness, organization, and dedication. In anything I do, I always put my very best effort, and that is a vital skill in entrepreneurship. I am also very excited by the opportunity to work on exciting passion projects with other UoM students. No single person has had the same experiences, so by bringing our unique skills and talents together, we have the potential to make something great.","I have been video editing for the past 6 years. Since 2018, I have created ~150 edits of my favorite TV show (New Girl); the actor Lamorne Morris (who plays the character Winston Bishop on the show) even happened to see two of them and liked them on Instagram. :)

I also enjoyed drawing characters from my favorite shows like Wild Kratts. (I’m a proud “PBS Kids” kid) Reading adventure books like Ranger’s Apprentice made me want to write my own story.  Heck, I even wrote a couple of poems back then. The euphoric joy of bringing to life my own creations was a constant source of inspiration. 

In middle school, I progressed to LEGO-Mindstorms and built maps for Minecraft server game modes. Early high-school, I joined the robotics team where we made it to the FIRST-Robotics World Championship 2 times. 

However, these past 3 years, I sacrificed my creativity for exceptional grades. Taking random AP classes to boost my GPA instead of unleashing my imagination on personal projects was a mistake I deeply regretted. 

Gradually, my passion started to become rekindled in college. Seeing all the complex projects whether it’s architecture, animation, or software, has sparked my interest. Additionally, researching a lot of small-cap stocks has made me realize the endless possibilities of applications one can create. 
","As a member, I will view myself as a unique puzzle piece in V1. 

Drawing from my heavy customer-centric perspective from past work experiences, I aspire to be a selfless member who is known for their hospitality, and someone anyone can talk to for ideas. Likewise, I intend to be mentored by an exceptional network of students, alumni, and founders,  ultimately ‘10x’ing my entrepreneurial knowledge. I am keen on fostering insightful discussions with other talented, driven individuals to bring our creative ideas to life. More importantly, I can’t wait to meet a group of people I can call my best friends and contribute to V1’s cause of changing the toxic entrepreneurial environment into one that’s welcoming and cooperative.

All in all, I will continue to bring my diverse perspective to a broader V1 community, where each of our unique contributions come together to form an extraordinary whole.

	Throughout high school, my focus on learning and building my skills flourished. As a freshman, I had already learned data structures at my local community college, which I utilized in my robotics team, Vulcan Robotics. Self-study became my ally as I researched autonomous robot control and concepts such as PID and Kalman Filters, eventually even building a custom pathfinding simulation platform, allowing bot testing without field presence.
	Even now, the pursuit of knowledge continues to drive me. As a part of the Michigan Daily, I spearheaded a project using AI/Machine Learning and Computer Vision to extract and reformat archived news articles into more modern transcriptions. Now, at V1, I see an opportunity to merge my diverse experiences/knowlege, passion for learning, and entrepreneurial spirit to unlock more opportunities for both me and my peers.
","I'm drawn to V1 as it stands out as an unparalleled community for fostering student tech entrepreneurship. The diverse projects, from hangout apps like Push to incredible AI implementations, showcase the community's ingenuity and diversity. Furthermore, what sets V1 apart is its unique ability to offer extensive connections in the tech realm. From small startups to larger companies such as Retool, V1 will allow me to broaden my network and interact with veterans in the field. As a member, I’d bring a diverse skill set and a passion for innovation.

My experiences creating diverse projects in these fields have been truly exhilarating. I aim to continue building and learning by joining Michigan's premier club for student-builders.

My journey as a builder began when I aimed to address the challenges faced by local businesses during the pandemic by designing nine practical websites to showcase their products. This initiative was successful in connecting businesses with hundreds of customers.

Venturing into bioinformatics, I became a research intern at UCF and dedicated myself to developing computational algorithms for discovering cancer solutions. After three years, I published my findings in a Nature Journal and presented at the 2023 AACR Conference, reaching hundreds of researchers.

Last year, I became a founding software developer at TurtleTank. Backed by numerous organizations and currently advising 10 startups, TurtleTank focuses on using code to advance sustainability. I've helped improve our main website using React and Node, and we even have a blog page powered by GraphQL. 

As I transition through college and beyond, the prospect of delving deeper into these fields thrills me. I am committed to continue innovating and making an impact. ","Introduced to the V1 community at last year's startup fair, I was immediately captivated by the passion exhibited by its members in creating startups and product development.

I am drawn to V1 because of its vibrant community and the collaborative spirit that defines it. I aspire to contribute my diverse skill set in web development, biotechnology, and AI, bringing a fresh perspective to collaborative projects. I also have experience building an idea from the ground up, and I would be eager to share this expertise in V1. Through actively participating in projects, I aim to enhance the community's innovative landscape.

In return, I hope to absorb valuable insights, unique opportunities, and support among members, greatly enriching my understanding of entrepreneurship and product development.

I have endeavored to build an appreciation for mathematics and promote equity in access to mathematical knowledge in my community.

During high school, I noticed a general lack of interest in mathematics among students. They were often taught to plug values into formulas and were rarely exposed to the derivations and logic behind equations. As a result, students only had a superficial understanding, causing math to become repetitive and boring. I sought to cultivate an interest in math by tutoring kids and explaining formulas with visual and intuitive proofs. The arduous memorization of trigonometry ratios became constructing lines within triangles to show the relationship between the sides; the complicated quadratic formula became adding together rectangles and matching their areas. I weaved in more advanced topics to show students how basic arithmetic is the foundation for advanced topics not learned until university. As the students actively asked questions and mentioned that they relied less on rote memorization, I felt gratified that I could convey my passion for these fields. 
","With hard work and dedication, technical skills for a stable job can be acquired. Yet I believe our lives are about creating meaning for ourselves, not a company or the economy. We yearn for self-actualization and seek to innovate. This is precisely what entrepreneurship is—by channeling our creativity, knowledge, and ambition, we etch our own mark on this world, while enhancing our collaboration, analytical, and communication skills.

V1 offers a diverse, vibrant, and driven community of students united by the shared passion of entrepreneurship. At V1, I anticipate collaborating with passionate students on projects to apply my technical knowledge, learning from experienced members on how to turn my ideas into tangible products, and attending startup fairs to build connections while polishing my ideas. I’ll strive to take initiative to plan events to attract more builders to V1, reach out and invite founders, and motivate peers to explore, discover, and innovate.","I recently become interested in Nietzschean philosophy, and his concepts of the ubermensch, the will to power, and Amor Fati.

I Integrated Cross-Entropy Cost Functions and a Multivariable Logistic Regression, creating models that predicted the probability of a player contributing a certain volume of an attacking action within 4% of actual occurrence. The model confirmed bookmakers were manipulating gamblers with distorted enhanced odds.

In Jakarta, a few friends and I launched AQI Solutions, aiming for cleaner air within poor communities. After months of research and numerous failed prototypes we aerated Spirulina in a recycled plastic bottle and connected it to a recycled box-fan HEPA filter, to reduce both dangerous gas concentrations and particulate matter. Our final product is at a fifth of the price of industrial air purifiers, at 70% the efficiency.","I am captivated by V1's tech-centric community. Having heard of Peter Wu's positive experiences, I am eager to immerse myself in a collaborative environment where diverse minds converge to create cutting-edge solutions.

My programming journey started with participation in academic problem-solving competitions. However, following my experience in a data science lab last summer, I discovered a genuine interest in project-based work. The completion of the EECS183 Arduino project further solidified my passion for engaging in project-based coding. My favorite project I’ve done was the Arduino assignment in my EECS183 class last semester. The core task involved recreating the Space Invaders game. Yet, what made it truly special was our project reach – designing a simplified version of Taiko No Tatsujin, a Japanese drumming game. Unlike typical problem-solving tasks, this project allowed vast space for creativity. We infused the game with different colors and unique frame designs, showcasing boundless possibilities. Additionally, I coded extra features like a difficulty menu. What I value most about project-based work is its collaborative nature. Assigning different roles maximizes our potential, and when we encounter hardware and software problems, open discussions lead to efficient solutions. This blend of creativity and hands-on implementation not only offers a fulfilling and enriching experience but also prepares me for future challenges in the constantly evolving world of technology.","In V1, the development and building process offers great flexibility, fostering increased creativity and the ability to create projects that are both useful and beneficial to society. In research projects and other events beyond my major, I’ve demonstrated a capacity for innovative thinking and presenting unique ideas within a team setting. I also excel in hands-on work, as I find it more engaging and aligns with my learning style. V1 provides an opportunity for me to transition seamlessly from competition-based programming to crafting projects that address real-world problems. More importantly, V1 allows me to put in all my creativity and wild ideas to build up mind-blowing projects. I am eager to acquire new skills at V1 and apply my hands-on expertise to contribute to team projects, fostering creativity and contributing to the community.","I love expressing my creativity through dance and baking.

V1 cohort provides members with the chance to test their potential and develop their skills both technically and interpersonally. Through my time in cohort, I aspire to collaborate with fellow entrepreneurial-minded students and gain the mentorship to create and grow as a builder. I am also ecstatic to actively engage and help facilitate V1 events such as MHacks to continue fostering an environment of ambitious builders. After talking to V1 members about their experiences, from working days away coding on a couch to learning about the merging of two innovative clothing based cohort projects, I am beyond excited to contribute and learn from the V1 community.

Over that summer, I was able to complete an app and was able to send it to my teacher which he used to explained the ideal gas laws to the incoming class. 
I'm passionate about using technology in a way that crosses functionality. Currently my eye is on crosses between Machine Learning and humanities, where technology meets functionality perfectly. I am involved in research with technology and humanities, which I did not realize is very similar to entrepreneurial efforts as you are creating something from scratch and in good faith.

Three years ago, a friend introduced me to ""Too Good To Go"", a mobile app which connects restaurants with surplus food to customers willing to buy it for a reduced price. I was captivated by the idea alone - how it mutually benefitted people and businesses, helping society as a whole. I had just started learning to code, and I made it my goal to eventually build something for the common good using those skills.

I eventually became more experienced in CS, and took on the challenge of a hackathon. The prompt was to build something that is environmentally conscious, and our group decided to build a web app, EcoLink, that connects users to environmental volunteering opportunities posted by others in their community. Although the UI was beginner at best, the concept itself made me so excited about it. Others felt the same way, and we ended up winning an award for it. I built on this momentum, eventually building ParkR, a much more advanced app that routes users to crowd-sourced parking spots in NYC. I hope to further develop my skills and build more projects for social benefit by joining V1.","I am drawn to V1's diverse community of like-minded builders and the exposure to startups it provides. I am constantly inspired by the entrepreneurial spirit of many students at Michigan, and joining V1 would only increase my engagement with this vibrant ecosystem. V1's many events would allow me to grow professionally and as a entrepreneur. I also believe that bringing my unique perspective and experiences to V1 could help others form and improve ideas for projects, as I could inspire others to gear technology towards improving urban environments. Raised in Brooklyn, New York, several of my projects are aimed towards helping people in cities such as my own. A key example of this is my ParkR project, which addresses the issue of limited street parking in cities. I hope to bring my innovative perspective to V1, as well as benefit from those of the many like-minded builders in the community.","I love exploring abandoned sectors of urban environments - I recently explored the abandoned Seaview Hospital of Staten Island, NY, a former tuberculosis sanitarium last used in the 1950s.

That desire led to Maize Entertainment, where I worked on the development along with some other students of a full-stack web application aimed at connecting various art forms across the University of Michigan, including film, art, music, and poetry. This platform, designed with React.js and backed by DynamoDB, provides a dynamic space for artists to showcase their work creatively. I gained hands-on experience in deploying cloud-based solutions by implementing AWS services. Furthermore, integrating various APIs by creating 15+ lambda functions, like content management and user interaction was a key learning point, significantly simplifying the user experience and enabling seamless social interaction. This project honed my technical skills in full-stack development, cloud services and also enhanced my abilities in user engagement and cross-disciplinary collaboration. Maize Entertainment is innovative because it’s the first platform for artists to connect with each other and let people appreciate their work. The plan is to launch on January 22nd on campus and it's a project that I am proud to be a part of.","I'm keen on V1 due to its alignment with my passion for fostering collaboration and innovation. My project, Maize Entertainment, focuses on connecting artists and showcasing their work, making V1's creative community appealing. I aim to offer my experience in full-stack development, cloud solutions, and user engagement, benefiting others with similar projects. In return, I'm eager to gain insights, network, and learn from fellow entrepreneurs in V1. I know I have only just started to explore the world of entrepreneurship, and I hope I can gain more insights on how to gain a strong consumer base as well as tips for getting an effective launch. The goal is to further develop Maize Entertainment and collaborate with V1 members and be a part of their projects as well.

The obvious approach was to incorporate a motor-powered arm. However, experimenting with bands, servos, and pneumatic suctioning had us facing numerous failures. After countless iterations, the conventional claw struggled to grip the cone reliably, bands provided weak friction, and suctioning drew too much voltage. Instead, I challenged the status quo and incorporated a more innovative design: a four-bar linkage system. Utilizing four Gecko Wheels and a chain-sprocket mechanism, our robot suctioned the cone with unparalleled efficiency, ultimately earning us the Think Award at the FTC Robotics Competition.

As the mechanical lead, I constantly confronted dilemmas that demanded quick thinking and the ability to unite our team’s diverse insights, spanning strategy, software, mechanics, and business operations. Although daunting, it was gratifying to see my teammates’ ideas coming to fruition together. Facing such challenges alongside my peers ignites my passion for venturing beyond the ordinary.
","Who doesn’t love some pizza?

 I certainly do. But, for me, a local pizzeria in Philadelphia delivered more than just the delicious flavors that linger in my mouth. As I worked on their website, the pizzeria’s world underwent a digital transformation. Suddenly, this neighborhood gem gained a robust online presence, amplifying its brand and name. Customers could seamlessly explore menus, place orders, and access exclusive deals with just a few clicks—truly demonstrating technology's power in enhancing small businesses.

Software in itself is not what fuels my passion, but rather the impact and room for creativity it has in today’s world. I believe my blend of technology and entrepreneurship contributes to V1’s commitment to promoting entrepreneurship and creativity.

 V1 doesn’t just provide the largest community of student builders that I can grow alongside professionally, but also the opportunity to be part of a diverse group of individuals unlike any other on campus.

I dabbled in crocheting, sculpting, and metalworking. The design process from brainstorming to researching to testing was my forte. But even with my creative hobbies, math remained my greatest strength and passion. So, when I discovered CS–a field with a relentless pursuit of learning, problem-solving, freedom, and creation–I shifted my builder journey in the tech direction.
My most recent project was The ClawMachine. With a team of 4, we created a playable 3D-printed claw machine which won first place at Wayne State University’s Design Expo. Though this was a project for our CAD class, I motorized it with Arduino to give us an advantage for the competition. I worked on implementing 5 motors to make the claw joystick-controlled, and its lowering/closing was automated with a button. I had to learn and implement the wiring and coding of the motors in highly complex systems within 10-weeks. It resulted in a lot of Googling, late-nights, and hands-on learning, but it was gratifying seeing others play with it during the competition. So to me, being a builder entails learning and creatively using logic to create a product out of ideas.
","My interest in V1 is grounded in my passion for product design and startups. These spheres thrive on dedication and innovative thinking, qualities that I have practiced during my time with TechTown– a hub for Detroit start-ups. I was paired with the Wilson Adaptive Technology (WAT), a startup focused on producing portable showers for disabled individuals. Collaborating with the senior team to improve UI design, SEO, and user-specific content, we worked to establish a robust brand for WAT. Engaging in a well-structured project under mentorship enhanced my technical writing and web-development skills in agile software development life cycle. I aim to bring this unique blend of technical skills and nuanced understanding of start-up dynamics to advance V1’s projects and connect with V1’s network of startups. I look forward to gaining further mentorship and exploring avenues for personal, professional, and social growth within V1's community.","I was born in Mumbai, but I moved between the US and India frequently which made me very adaptable since I had to change schools 9 times in total.

After actively leading sustainability-focused and coding clubs, I founded a computational sustainability non-governmental organization of 40 members to expand reach to local schools and corporations in Lagos, Nigeria. The issue had an impact on me personally and it became my mission to solve the problem because it would develop sustainable practices and effect global change. Through the organization, we organized a plastic-bottle boat race challenge in local schools and collectively raised over $2000. These funds were used to launch a large-scale plastic reduction project which helped in supporting schools to replace their plastic packaging materials with paper containers and banana leaves. Overall, we minimized at least 100 kilograms of plastic waste while educating students how to use eco-friendly alternatives. While pursuing this plastic-reduction project, the data analytics team used visualization tools to appreciate the reduction in carbon footprint through the change from plastic to paper packaging. Moreover, we created a minimum viability carbon footprint tracker app which helped users track their individual carbon footprint. We tested it internally amongst the organization and received strong positive feedback. In essence, through the organization, I acted as a changemaker and created an invested sustainability community, initiating actionable change, and empowering youth to become global leaders.
","I am drawn to V1 to continue my role as a changemaker in the sustainability community by developing actionable projects with like-minded individuals. I have always been passionate about building a product so I am driven to network with individuals and build a startup that initiates actionable change. Moreover, I will leverage the personalized recruiter chats to cultivate strong connections with the recruiter and appreciate what the company really expects from young entrepreneurs. In V1, I will lead by example and encourage members to collaboratively solve sustainability issues using data visualization tools such as Tableau and PowerBi. Coming from a high school of 67 different nationalities, I will build a more inclusive and vibrant community and also support women to devise entrepreneurial and innovative solutions.

This interest of mine stems from a personal incident in my family in the past. My dad has a small store that sells various knick-knacks and toys, and he has a website for online merchandising. However, he uses WordPress’ eCommerce plugin, WooCommerce, which is known for their security vulnerabilities. And unfortunately, we became the victims of such a breach, which was devastating financially. From this, I became interested in the realm of computer security and developing reliable systems that are safe from malicious actors.

To further explore this field, one project I’ve created is an image steganography tool. It allows users to either embed a secret message within an image or extract a message from one. It supports LSB insertion/extraction, as well as randomized LSB insertion/extraction. It also has the ability to cycle through the red-green-blue color channels to see if there is a hidden message that way. This project helped me learn about lower-level binary manipulation. In addition, another project I built was a simple port scanner tool. It scans for open ports on an address, and I got some experience working with sockets and threads.","Last semester, I connected with V1 through Ship-It-Sundays and volunteering for MHacks. During MHacks, I remember Raghav, Anirudh, and others brainstorming ideas for the CTF. They contemplated putting a secret message in NFC, but I suggested a QR code disguised in a flyer could work better, to which they agreed. Despite being a random volunteer, they still listened to me, which I appreciated and found indicative of the inclusive/collaborative nature V1 has. And during Ship-It-Sundays, I’d see Product Studio groups work together and solve problems on the whiteboard. It is this collaborative and innovative spirit that makes me interested in V1. I want to work alongside 10x engineers – people who I could go to hackathons with, and people who I could learn from or teach a thing or two.

Stemming from my passion for education and in the hope to have some impact, I co-founded a company with senior students to recommend career-centric certificates and study guidelines. During this process, I learned the joy of not only building a software, but also building a company, and building a team. Through cohort, I hope to build a team to develop a service that optimizes credit distribution and course planning to reduce tuition by taking some credits at local community colleges.

Starting a company is also a form of building. The reason why I’m interested in entrepreneurship is because I want to gain a bigger influence in the world-–to change the world. My goal is to use the profits I earn from an EdTech startup to found an energy company, and I believe that the V1’s resources will greatly help me achieve this goal.","The reason why I moved to America was to start a globally influential company.

This is being made in hopes of helping Michigan’s community maintain healthier and more coherent eveniroments. Additionally in Ross’s Innovation had I contributed ot the development of the house management app which ended up getting us a finals award!

In Highschool my two largest projects were created to assist Ukraine after It was invaded. My Refugee web-app centered round breaking down communication barriers between The Ukrainian Refugees and Romainain voulenteers, and my charity allowed me to talk to multiple school and gather funds to donate for humanitarian aid. While these projects were born out of necessity, they never deviated from the servitude of a community of People. 

My most recent encounter with building has to do with building a community. Tasked with educating the Umich community about Ukrainian culture, my current challenge will not be accomplished alone. 
","V1 is a place to fail. There is no better place in Michigan to try a project. If that flops, we try again, if it flops we try again. 

Acting like Michigan’s YCombinator, V1’s diverse portfolio of connections, recrouces and mentors all make V1 extremely important and valuable for someone who is interested in creating. Another important benefit of V1 is that the students who make up this community are truly interested in eutrepenurship and being surrounded by like minded people who are willing to be obsessed with a venture is incredibly valuable for me. 

I hope to give V1 one a tenacious member wh’s willing to take risks and learn. Regardless, I hope to give the V1 community one more person to have fun with. Wether it be in retreats, ship it sundays or hackathons the V1 community can always grow with one more person.

I went to a bunch of winter and summer coding camps like IDTech in the US to create platformer and RPG games when I was in elementary school and Make School in Japan to create iOS apps when I was in middle school. In Make School, I created a to do list that keeps track of your tasks and a game where you try to tap on foxes that pop up to prevent them from killing your chickens. One time I let my cousin, nine years younger than me, play my fox game and when I heard his exclamations of joy, I was spurred to continue creating. In high school, I interned at various different tech companies to continue my growth since my high school didn’t offer much besides AP computer science. At Mars Flag, I learned full-stack web development to create an anime recommendation website that utilizes the user’s preferences in genre. Most recently, I utilized ChatGPT and Stable Diffusion to create a workflow that converts books to comics, although I didn’t get to complete it. ","I’m interested in V1 because of their community and support. I feel like I haven’t found my own community yet where I fully belong, and I think V1 would be an environment where I can find that community since I heard great things about it from current V1 members, Leo and Johnathan. I also know that I can accomplish great things when I’m surrounded by like-minded people who are striving for similar goals or are working together with me because when I’m not in such an environment, I don’t work on individual projects. I hope that I can contribute to the community by developing my skills, and then later on helping newer members with their skills because I enjoy teaching. Since I’m international, I don’t know much about the tech industry/space, so I hope I can get mentorship and support for my career.","I'm half Japanese and half Korean.

My journey as a builder reflects this ethos. I'm passionate about creating things that resonate with me on a personal level, while blending technology and creativity.

I've gotten the opportunity to build and launch a business that allowed gaming-related social media groups to convert their audience into customers for high quality clothing, turn my love for photography and art into the first print-on-demand framed poster service in Morocco, and even make a few fun utility apps along the way, most of which have only ever been used by myself.

Each project on my builder journey has been a step towards understanding and harnessing the power of self-expression. They are not just projects but extensions of my identity. As for entrepreneurship, I see it as a path to turn these personal passions into avenues that others can explore and enjoy, creating value from the unique perspectives that define us.","I am drawn to V1 because of its reputation as a vibrant community of innovative thinkers and builders. The opportunity to connect with like-minded individuals who share a passion for technology, creativity, and entrepreneurship is immensely appealing. I believe that being part of V1 will not only allow me to contribute my unique perspective and growing skillset, but also enable me to grow both personally and professionally.

Growing up in Morocco and adhering to a very cookie-cutter way of life, I found that innovative thinkers were few and far between. Joining the V1 community would allow me to integrate the beehive I could never find back home, and hopefully enable me to inspire its members just as much as they inspire me.","I was a really curious kid growing up and would endlessly bug my father to let me use his computer.

I looked affectionately at the heap of blankets that was my younger cousin, his soft voice barely breaking the room's silence.

“Even better,” I whispered. “Brothers.”

My cousin suffers from Autism Spectrum Disorder. Nothing was more painful than watching him struggle to keep up with his peers during those pandemic-forced virtual school sessions; I decided to help.

After months of tutorials, articles, and late-night coding sessions on app development, I launched Autific, an iOS app that uses OpenCV to administer Pivotal Response Treatment therapy. The app also contains grammar, math, and pattern recognition games to stimulate cognitive functions.

This coding venture marked my initiation into the vast realm of technology's impact. I soon received an internship at ASU, building meaningful medical technology before working in VR at UCSB. I’ve completed numerous other personal projects ranging from Web3 to CAD — all from my love for my cousin.","As a child, the sprint to my bedroom after turning off the light switch always filled me with dread. The dark was my biggest fear, yet my uncle lived in it. Born blind, his world was dark, and I felt compelled to change that.

I created AI4Sight, a mobile app utilizing trained OpenCV-based ML models to announce objects in real-time video feeds. This empowers blind users to independently interact with their surroundings efficiently.

My unique perspective, shaped by critical thinking and empathy developed as an Eagle Scout volunteer, combines philanthropy with technology. The excitement of building cutting-edge projects to address societal issues, attending career fairs, and collaborating with like-minded peers defines my journey.

While V1's tech-focused, lighthearted, and collaborative environment aligns with my passion, I recognize that V1 is more than STEM—it strikes the elusive work-play balance college students seek. Eager to contribute, I envision bringing both my dedicated and relaxed sides to the community, embracing the epitome of work-hard, play-hard ethos.","I’m batman.

Although this was for a mid-sized school club, it was a pivotal experience to me. After months of intense self-learning, I designed a chassis with a collector that fed blocks to an elevator arm: less risk of dropping, more efficient building. I then developed a knack for quickly visualizing and programming machine systems.

My first achievement was the Best Robot Design Award, but my even bigger success was newfound enthusiasm to pursue experience-based learning. I’ve since worked my way from being a shadow at an award winning research group at the University of Chicago to conducting individual sub-research in bioelectronic materials; I've since worked up from doing assistant work at an asset management to coding a program for them that generates investment analysis reports; I’ve since taught myself to program adeptly, from a self-engineered drone to a machine learning project in my dorm that I now want to expand with V1. My goal is to bring this enthusiasm for experience-based learning to every endeavor henceforth.","I recently started working with PyTorch and I hope to develop a program that uses machine learning from my personal data to organize files on my computer.

It enabled the robot to distinguish and react to objects based on their spatial positioning and predefined situational parameters, attempting to detect game-specific objects with up to 95% accuracy.

This project not only honed my technical skills in robotics and computer vision but also sparked my interest in entrepreneurship. The ability to create solutions that can transform ideas into tangible, functional technologies has been immensely fulfilling. It's this intersection of innovation, technology, and real-world application that excites me, and I am eager to explore further opportunities in this dynamic field.","My interest in V1 stems from its vibrant ecosystem of ambitious student builders. As an individual deeply immersed in technology and innovation, I am drawn to V1's commitment to nurturing a diverse community of engineers, artists, designers, founders, and scientists. This rich blend of perspectives is a fertile ground for collaborative learning and creativity.

I hope to contribute my experience in robotics and computer vision, especially in integrating hardware and software to create innovative solutions. My background in participating in projects like the FIRST Robotics Competition has equipped me with unique insights that I am eager to share. In return, I anticipate gaining invaluable mentorship from industry leaders and peers who have navigated similar paths. I look forward to engaging in dynamic exchanges of ideas and experiences, which I believe will be instrumental in shaping my entrepreneurial journey and helping me grow both professionally and personally in this exciting community.","I like to work hard and play hard.

Starting with building a LEGO robot, I’d come to revel in the joy of engineering, graduating to programming my own metal and wire creations in Java. 

The possibilities grew in my senior year, when I created my own course through the Gifted & Talented program, as an excuse to waste my school’s 3D-printer filament and circuitry to attempt to build a remote-controlled car. Even after numerous mishaps from messed-up prints to short circuits the elation at completing a project only heightened. Every creation—from the hand-crank generator to the levitating lamp—were made of parts I designed with CAD, controlled by circuits I soldered, and followed instructions of code I wrote. 

My excitement for building spilled over into the field of computer science as well. From straightforward games like Pong in Java or Tic-Tac-Toe in C++ to a white cane capable of object detection through a LiDAR sensor and Raspberry pi. 

Creating, by hand or by computer screen, has made me incredibly passionate about startups and entrepreneurship, where innovation and building take center stage.","I know how long a charge takes to spread out on a capacitance circuit, but I want to know how I can use that to create a circuit for pacemakers that shock with greater accuracy. V1 can graduate my curiosity to advance them into tangible projects and careers. 

The prospect of collaborating with people who share my interests and can act as mentors to guide me is particularly thrilling. It will provide a more structured path to focus my intrinsic drive with clear objectives and a community of like-minded individuals.

At V1 I’ll be able to meet people from all walks of life, whether they’re the industry experts I'll encounter as guest speakers, or fellow innovators showcasing their inventions at the startup fair. Gaining experience from diverse and informed perspectives while simultaneously providing my own opinions and genuine interest is what V1 offers me, and what I can offer you.","As kids my sister and I used to create ""makeshift books"" out of stapled & cut pieces of paper and something barely resembling a plot. Now, instead of just stories written from my sister’s eccentric ideas, I sometimes publish short stories of my own in response to any interesting prompts on r/WritingPrompts. ",

My roommate can attest to this. Earlier this year, we constructed a gingerbread house, and I was committed to creating the most stable structure with crisp icing designs. When her fan malfunctioned, I jumped at the opportunity to repair it, viewing it as a challenge. I even raced to fix the stand under my turtle tank faster than my Dad could. My interests are diverse and ever-changing as I continuously explore and cultivate new hobbies. Lately, I’ve been obsessed with Henna and have been trying to get my hands on some organic cones. In the past, I spent my time on the robotics team, contributing to both the mechanical and business aspects. The entrepreneurial aspect of any club has always appealed to me, leading to successful trips with my DECA and BPA teams to national and international events. I take pleasure in pitching new ideas and strategizing ways to market the next best idea!
","There are so many clubs here at Michigan, but V1 is genuinely my top choice. Over the past month, I’ve read every newsletter (as I mentioned to Shrey during BBA), and I was particularly struck by the generosity during the Women in Entrepreneurship event, where members supported each other like a family. V1 not only offers the sense of community I seek at Michigan, but also presents projects that align with my entrepreneurial and technical interests. Talking to Diya about her fashion design project made me realize that V1’s offerings would bolster my resume and provide valuable mentorship.This application itself, for example, has prompted me to create a portfolio I previously lacked. I really like the aspect that V1 welcomes a diverse range of interests yet unites everyone with a common goal: build something great.

At the time, the best way to approach this was joining the STEM club with peers, collaborating to build projects. Despite our success with our first project, I didn’t find myself entirely passionate about what we were making: an app which rewards users for throwing away trash. Though I found interest in its creation, it must address the issue of decreasing litter in Pennsylvania, and the prompt wasn’t one I was immersed in. Thus, when we returned next year, we decided to sign up for a competition with a more open prompt. This time, I had a different approach: people-based engineering. From talking with community members and identifying their struggles to finding business partners for professional and technical advice, we had to both identify and solve the problem. Whether it be creating a device to battle drop foot, inspired by a faculty member suffering from multiple sclerosis, or building a robot to autonomously shovel snow after a friend’s father injured himself, I found that my passion is to empathize with others to truly understand their struggles; only then can I build truly meaningful products.","Even though most people have similar interests at V1, each individual has a unique way to express and apply their skills, creating a diverse community of builders who can both inspire projects along with providing mentorship to other peers’ products. Moreover, V1 offers development opportunities to help guide projects to launch-worthy products, from the startup fair to events that collaborate with larger companies. Along with these technical benefits, the variety of members also offers potential interdisciplinary collaboration, whether it be combining various forms of computer science or completely different disciplines in general. As a member of this vibrant community, especially as a part of the project studio cohort, I hope to gain guidance on how to properly apply my interest in computer science toward building significant products I am passionate about, eventually being able to provide such advice and new technical approaches to incoming and current members.","I played the drum set while recording a song in the same studio which Elvis Presley recorded in (RCA Studio B in Nashville).

I participated in the ACE Mentorship project in my junior year where we were tasked with creating a software prototype of a site in the Detroit area. 

The Hudson site used to be the second-biggest department store. Our task was to make a model of the new building that could be built there using the Autodesk Revit software. It was an incredible learning experience because it taught me new software and the importance of teamwork and time management. 

I also learned that only a good design doesn't suffice the constraints: every object must be economical for the customer. Any product must have a competitive price, or the market will choose the cheaper alternative. 

I always dreamed of having my startup. I have a couple of ideas, which could potentially revolutionize the market if implemented properly. Therefore, I am pursuing a major in electrical engineering and aiming to learn the business aspect from V1.","V1 is a community where I can meet avid, aspiring future entrepreneurs. After attending the mass meeting, I learned that there is a lot to learn from everyone.  The innovative startup ideas from some people genuinely captivated my mind and motivated me even more to push my limits and think outside the box, which is why I am interested in V1.

I hope to give all my time and dedication to this community so that we can build it even better for the upcoming students: a community where future students will have more opportunities than us to try and test their ideas. I hope to bring my best ideas and implement them in the workspace with my peers. 

I intend to learn from people who are more experienced than me and whose knowledge can enable me to become a better entrepreneur in the future. I hope to foster long-term relationships with my team members. ","I guess I am going to India this summer after 6 years.","One final note I would like to include is that even though my profile and work experience may not be as impressive as some other candidates, I assure you that I am more passionate than any one of them. 

I moved from India in eighth grade, knowing nothing about the American education system. I was very mediocre in the beginning as I only did what my counselor recommended. Of course, she recommended me the easiest classes so that my transition could be smooth. 

It wasn't until my sophomore year I learned about the importance of AP classes and extracurricular activities. I started my freshman year with Algebra 1 and ended my senior year with the completion of Calculus III. To emphasize the point, I came to the university as a sophomore, which is quite a big deal because, until my sophomore year, I had no clue what I was doing.

The goal of the abovementioned blurb was not to brag but rather to prove the point that I am very hardworking, passionate, and ambitious. 

I would like to conclude my note by thanking the team for reviewing my application.

Thanks.

Over a few months, my ideas kept getting better and I came up with a genuine problem that I could try solving: breaking down and understanding research papers.

So, I started building over break,

With some inspiration from LangChain, I built a PDF Q&A platform. In its state now, it is a GPT wrapper. However, I envision the final version to turn reading research papers into a dynamic visual experience (check notion for more info!). While building I learned a lot but also, I picked up some of my old interests in art and design as I was building out the UI for this project. You can find the WIP here: easyres.vercel.app

Additionally, inspired by Maria's passion for impactful work in startups, I hope to not only improve my confidence as a builder but also to be part of a community that consistently motivates me to create a lasting impact through my endeavors.","I have managed to live in 3 different countries, 7 different cities, and 10 different homes in the past 19 years.","Had a great time meeting members of the cohort!"

Because of my early introduction to computers, my love fruitioned itself into computer-based building: programming. In 7th grade, I created a text game for my cousin, and after building it out I learned a lot of fundamentals. This motivated me to join robotics, where I got introduced to project-based programming, and carried out a 3-year library project, involving 3 full iterations, becoming fully plug-and-play.
Although I was very computer-minded, I soon recognized that I could implement the same concept in my hobby, photography. After my friends were surprised that I was a photographer, I realized that I should be not just keeping my love for the hobby to myself, and should be sharing it with everyone. So, I created my Instagram account, where I post my favorite photos for everyone to enjoy my content the same way I do.
Overall, this grew into an entrepreneurship mindset where I’ve enjoyed building things from scratch. It never mattered what I built, but the feeling of taking an idea and building something of value to me and growing it into something others gain enjoyment from satisfies me on its own.","Recently, I’ve gotten interested in startups and each of their ‘storylines’. After going to the Startup Fair, it was intriguing to see how much companies varied in how they founded an idea to how they are progressing. Although the Startup Fair was very informative, I realized I needed to get my hands dirty to comprehend how to get a startup off the ground. I believe that my drive to start something new from scratch needs to have a solid foundation before I can be convinced that I can successfully start my own–even if it leads to failure. I hope to gain valuable experience and understanding through not only V1’s vast mentorship and resources/knowledge base but also be allowed to be held accountable for learning how to initiate the process of starting a startup. Given this, I hope to continue the spread of this knowledge and understanding beyond V1.","My favorite style of Maggi is with onions and tomatoes with chilli/paprika powder, so it's actually spicy.

This passion was explored by seeking out a mentor, who introduced me to IoT, Arduino and Raspberry Pi projects. I translated this knowledge into practical applications, creating a smart light system and automated blinders for my room. My passion for applying technology in the physical world has driven me to create several projects.

Among these is a smart dustbin, designed to incentivize its usage to address the widespread issue of littering in India. I delved into the realm of accessible technology, developing an Indian Sign Language training coach utilizing computer vision. My passion for the automotive industry led me to create a navigation app, which determined routes based on quality of roads rather than total travel time, reducing maintenance costs for fleet owners. During COVID school closures, I founded a social organization that refurbished old laptops and donated them to underprivileged students. I developed a platform which connects corporate and household donors with the students.

Living in the startup capital of India has immersed me in an entrepreneurial environment, fueling my interest in entrepreneurship, which is an area I hope to improve and explore further.","While I have been interested in entrepreneurship for several years, I have lacked a structured program to bring to life projects that I wish to pursue. This is the main reason why I am attracted to V1 and the resources that are available to the community. I believe that with my commitment to using technology for good and the resources that V1 will provide, I can bring to life the various ideas in my head to fruition.

I hope to be able to connect with like minded individuals, and learn from their experiences and challenges. Having a network of individuals to learn from and collaborate with will make it easier and more fulfilling for me to work on projects that I am passionate about. Being an international student, I bring a fresh perspective to the V1 community, which can be leveraged to explore unique solutions to existing problems.","When I was 8 years old, I accidentally electrocuted my sister because I took apart her computer and forgot to put it back together.",

Similarly, my passions range across a wide spectrum, including entrepreneurship, dance, photography, music, and more. One of my favorite projects I have built is my work in the non-profit sector. In 2020, I started two education-related non-profit organizations that gave me a range of experiences in management, leadership, communication, marketing, and teamwork. Being in the startup and social impact space has kindled my desire to be a positive asset to the community around me and contribute to the issues present in society. Alongside my technical side, I have a strong interest in dance and photography. I have choreographed and performed numerous dances for different events, settings, and purposes. From selecting music to editing audio to originally coming up with steps to teaching to performing, I have been through this process enough to see its impact on my builder journey so far. It’s not just a performance–it’s an experience that I am looking forward to offering my audience, as every builder does. Through V1, I am excited to further my contribution and impact in the entrepreneurial space.","After talking to numerous V1 members and attending several events, V1 not only represents a tech entrepreneurship club, but a tight-knit community of builders and creators, united by a shared passion and mission to give to the community. This exact trait, along with the opportunities to meet new people, develop strong connections, and simply create, is why V1 is the ideal club for me. Through this, I intend to offer my individual and unique experiences, skillsets, and ideas to a group that will do the same for me. The collaboration, community-building, and unity of V1 are unparalleled to any other and excite me to be heavily involved. Specifically, I am looking forward to working at the crossroads of business and technology, two fields that I am extremely passionate about and intend to create a career in.

I recently created a financial app designed to streamline purchase transactions, reflecting my interest in the intersection of technology and daily life. However, my true passion lies in entrepreneurship, and I'm currently immersed in a project that integrates beauty and tech.

I am actively involved in building software for L'Oreal's competition, where I aim to address a long-standing issue within the POC (People of Color) community. Historically, finding the right beauty products, especially considering skin complexion, has been a challenge. To tackle this, I'm developing an app that utilizes cutting-edge technology to recommend the best beauty brands and shades tailored to individual skin tones.

For me, entrepreneurship is not just about creating innovative solutions; it's about making a positive impact. By leveraging today's technology, I aspire to contribute to minimizing the beauty product disparity that the POC community has faced for far too long. This project is a meaningful step towards using my technical skills to address real-world challenges and make a difference in an industry that impacts people's lives.","I am interested in V1 because it aligns with my aspiration to be part of a community that fosters growth and excellence. The prospect of building projects alongside exceptional individuals who challenge and inspire each other resonates with my commitment to continuous improvement. V1's focus on investing in people with high growth potential, driven by energy, initiative, and ambition, is particularly appealing. I believe that being part of V1 will not only allow me to contribute my skills and ideas to incredible projects but also provide me with a network of like-minded individuals who will propel me to reach my full potential. The emphasis on earning one's network through merit rather than payment aligns with my values of hard work and achievement. In joining V1, I hope to gain valuable experiences, exclusive opportunities within startups, and mentorship that will empower me to achieve great things in my academic and professional journey.","I make a batch of kimchi at 2am sharp every 2nd Saturday of the month and then binge NANA or Fairy Tail or One Punch Man.","I am a V1 Finalist from F23. :)"

One of the notable initiatives I co-founded is Dear Asian Youth Toledo, a response to the economic fallout caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. Our proactive approach involved reaching out to struggling small businesses, understanding their unique challenges, and devising strategies to offer crucial financial support. The process required building strong connections within the community, collaborating with local stakeholders, and navigating the complexities of fundraising to make a tangible impact.

Another significant endeavor in my builder journey is the establishment of the Realmind Movement, a non-profit dedicated to mental health awareness. The inception of this organization involved a meticulous planning process, from defining our mission to identifying key areas where we could make a meaningful difference. Organizing speaker events at numerous schools became a pivotal aspect of our strategy. This required extensive coordination, securing engaging speakers, and creating a platform that facilitated open conversations about mental health. The process was not without its challenges, but the collective effort of our team and the support of the community made it a rewarding endeavor.","I am drawn to V1 for its unique commitment to fostering genuine connections and support within a community of ambitious student builders. The experience of engaging in a one-on-one conversation with a member amidst the lively Winterfest atmosphere left a lasting impression of care and authenticity that I haven't encountered elsewhere on campus. This sense of genuine concern resonated deeply with me and prompted my interest in joining V1.
I aspire to bring my enthusiasm for creating positive social impact and my diverse skills as a changemaker to enhance the community.

In return, I am eager to tap into the extraordinary network that V1 offers, explore exclusive opportunities within startups, and benefit from mentorship that aligns with my goals. The prospect of being part of a community that values meaningful connections and facilitates the growth of its members is what I aspire to gain from my involvement with V1.","A fun fact is that I have a deep passion for fashion, and attending fashion shows is one of my absolute joys.

Before I got into tech, I was considering a career in healthcare, so that’s how I got into that. One couple I worked with, used to be Psychology professors at MSU, who also participated in extensive research before their retirement. Much of this anthropological research was in physical form: old books with folk tales, articles from newspapers detailing previous researchers’ travels and findings, etc. 
Being much more familiar with current computer programs and functions than the previous generation, they asked me to help digitalize all this data to be sent to current researchers continuing this project. Quickly, I took on the leading role in this data digitalization project, organizing the research materials, setting up the most efficient systems to convert the data, and, most importantly, keeping the integrity of the data intact. 
This project, which I suddenly became the head of, was the first time I had to develop a strategic plan, implement it myself, and make it accessible to others. Although this project isn't the most exciting or something I'm incredibly passionate about, it taught me leadership, organization, and vital planning skills. ","A few days ago, I got the opportunity to visit the Ann Arbor office of Deepgram, a startup that works on speech-to-text AI and has many large clients, including NASA. There, I spoke with one of the CFOs, head software engineer, researchers, and data scientists, who told me about their career journeys prior to starting at the company and experiences within it. I became incredibly interested in startups and I was asking my new contacts for advice on how to expand my connections. 
Later that day, I stumbled upon the V1 mass meeting, which turned out to be exactly what I was looking for! Hands-on experiences with project building, mentorship, community, startup fairs... And then, based on Amy’s Instagram reel, V1 seems like such a diverse and vibrant group that I would be so excited to join. I decided that this was providence and so here I am, applying.

However, my perception quickly changed during my senior year of high school. Being an avid competitive programmer and president of my school’s programming club, a group of 4 friends and I created an autograder for hosting local competitions. The project, starting as a local grading application, eventually evolved into a fully operational website with user registrations and a submissions database. Invigorated by the satisfying launch of our project and eager to learn more, I soon joined a project team as I entered college. While starting as a simple media-sharing application, in just under a year, it has evolved into a complex, functioning social-media platform, and is planning to launch and become a registered LLC in the upcoming month. Overall, as much as I’d like to attribute my interest in business to my interest in entrepreneurship, I truly believe that my hunger to create new things came from my father’s recommendation to study computer science. Today, my father is an aspiring entrepreneur building his own business, and he is not only my biggest inspiration but also my greatest mentor. ","Personally, I believe that the hallmark of entrepreneurship is paying attention to positive impact, so when I attended the startup fair last semester, I was pleased to see companies from CourierHealth, which focuses on supporting medical patients through life science developments, to Valon, focusing on making mortgage payments more manageable for families across the country. Further, when I was first introduced to V1 through Marcus, I was especially excited to hear about V1’s mentorship program for the Product Studio Program, as the world of entrepreneurship is still quite daunting to me, and I would love to grow my mindset around individuals with significant expertise in the field. Finally, I believe that collaboration in diverse fields is extremely important as an entrepreneur, and since I’ve experienced several fields in the industry, I hope to contribute by guiding others in the community through exploring such fields together.

Yet, recently, I've found myself returning to my roots, that entrepreneurial spirit rekindling. I started with Pioneer Software, an exciting venture into the world of B2B software development. I'm also playing around with this idea- Ponder, a concept for an AI-generated podcasting app. It's just an idea for now, but who knows what it could turn into? I really want to join V1 to have the space, the feedback, and the people to allow me to pursue these ideas, and perhaps more importantly, help others do the same. 

Recognizing this re-emerging passion, I realize the importance of surrounding myself with like-minded people. That's why I'm drawn to V1.

I see V1 as the perfect opportunity for this, a platform where I can not only meaningfully contribute but also learn from others who share similar aspirations.

This has been my intro to founders in the startup space, and I have found my diverse background in healthcare and business to equip me with a unique skill set, especially in advising the biotech space. Inspired by Peter Thiel's ""Zero to One,"" I see startups as champions of novel and transformative ideas, driving innovation. My goal is to contribute to the MedTech space, blending creativity with the technical knowledge I hope to gain as a physician. Thus far, I have experience working with a telehealth startup, building an AI medical assistant platform, and leading my team in M-Heal, for which we are currently in our design ideation phase, developing an assistive sit-to-stand device for caregivers working in underserved communities and confined spaces. In both of these experiences, I have had to be adaptable by learning new skills in CAD and machine learning. Engaging with startups and networking with diverse founders, I have found that a startup's success hinges more on its founders and team than the initial product. I believe I can find such passionate and relentless founders in V1. 
","Upon my arrival at the V1 Kickoff, I was genuinely taken aback by the sheer number of passionate individuals ardently working on projects they wholeheartedly believed in. Talking with Cooper and Brian, I found myself not only impressed by their product but also deeply inspired by their journey. More than anything else, I wish to be a part of a community of like-minded individuals who are just as passionate about startups as I am. I aim to establish an accelerator pod within V1, fostering a dynamic space where startups from the university can engage in mutually beneficial consulting projects with our V1 members. This will help us attract more diverse applicants, including Ross, and make V1 a one-stop shop for startups. I am also a venture scout, so I hope to source startups that I may encounter through this endeavor and help V1 members realize their inventions and scale appropriately.","A fun fact about me is that I am guaranteed to have the biggest hand and feet in V1. If given the chance, I hope to prove this :)","I am super passionate about V1's mission, and I think building an accelerator pod within V1 would be invaluable. I have spoken with many accelerators on campus like Desai, and I think establishing such a pod will allow V1 to not only gain consulting opportunities, which is invaluable, but also draw more diverse applicants.

I am a venture scout for LvlUp Ventures, which is an early-stage venture capital fund, and they invest around $200-250K in Pre-Seed & Seed Startups.

So for a project in AP Euro, I took upon myself to prove that mathematically Napoleon is the greatest general. Napoleon as a general was always seen as that guy who won but isn’t nearly as good as Alexander the Great or Caesar. I believed that a guy who 1vEurope’d for 3 consecutive wars should be just as good if not better than the undefeatable Alexander. So I dived in and examined every battle famous generals have been a part of. I compared generals to how well their theoretical second-in-command would do in the same position. For example in the Siege of El Arish Napoleon had 2,460 troops vs Ottomans 15,500. In that case my model predicted that Napoleon’s replacement had a 43% chance of winning such a siege, so he would win 0.57 points. Napoleon had a 38-5 record, the most battles of famous generals, and blew everyone out. While many traditional historians consider anecdotal evidence in determining the best, I used statistics and math to objectively prove it’s Napoleon.","I am interested in V1 to expand the skills I need to start a consulting firm.

Each member brought strengths that complemented our individual weaknesses. Personally, my familiarity with Python Selenium allowed me to contribute significantly to the development of the scraping script.

The turning point of the project was when we were brainstorming UI’s, and one of my teammates proposed a simple but very functional idea of sending automated emails to interact with users, which would prove to be more doable under our short timeline compared to our flashier initial idea to create a dynamic web app. Although he may not have been the most technically skilled, he was just as instrumental to the project by keeping the team on track to realistically finish our task.

V1 is the best opportunity for me to learn and get involved in the tech startup industry. I knew this last semester, but was hesitant to commit myself to learning how to code. My hesitancy stemmed from the idea that I didn't need it to do what I wanted to do with my career. V1's fall recruiting events were what initially got me thinking about this, and I had to really evaluate myself and my goals. My first consulting project with Michigan Blockchain has shown me that I can do more in the space with knowledge about the ""other side of things"". V1 can show me that side and build upon my prior knowledge to shape me as a business developer surrounded by like-minded individuals who care about their community's relationships as much as their professional endeavors.

In my junior year of high school, I developed a mobile android called PaCT (Pandemic Contact Tracer) during the summer of 2020 in the midst of the pandemic. It uses preloaded student data to automate the contact-tracing process so school administrators can quickly identify students who may have come in contact with the virus and subsequently quarantine them. I developed this app to make contact-tracing easier for schools once they reopened. In my senior year, I did a research project to detect anomalies in embedded systems through instruction-level classification via side-channel current analysis. The objective was to determine the extent to which machine-learning networks can classify assembly instructions running on microcontrollers. I had very limited knowledge coming to the project, but I’m not afraid to tackle new challenges and love the thrill of discovering new ways of doing things.","As a budding entrepreneur with technical experience developing my own contact tracing app and professional experience as a software engineering intern at the MITRE corporation for the past two summers, access to the incredible resources of V1 will finally help make my ideas a reality.

My builder journey started as a little kid tearing down remote-controlled cars to play with the motors, but now that same curiosity has transitioned towards building software and entrepreneurship. On the software side, taking some coding classes in H.S. made me want to consider it as a career. I love brainstorming a program (no matter how simple ) and making it a reality. On the entrepreneurship side, my brother and I wanted to start a business this summer and we thought starting a company that taught Nepalese kids the basics of coding using Scratch would be perfect. It was a long process at the start, we had to build a website, look at legal procedures, and make a course curriculum, but after working on it for a month straight, we ran our first class with about 20 students. Now, we have 100+ students as we launch more courses, and grow into a larger market.  Seeing a vision of a business and seeing it come to life has shown just how rewarding entrepreneurship can be.
","Simply, I am interested in V1 because of its combination of both entrepreneurship and software development. With my experience in the summer, I have come to realize that I want to start my own business sometime in the future. Overall, when I attended the Kickoff event at Ross, I found the fact that the project teams were able to imagine an idea and bring it to reality was very interesting to me. And because of that concept, I think that V1 can provide me with essential knowledge and experience in creating a product/start-up. It is a skill that is essential to my goals in the future, and being able to be a part of the V1 family would do just that.","I have done Taekwondo for 10 years.",

In response to my dad's restaurant closure, I spearheaded an app using Figma and Xcode to bring more business to local restaurants. Concerned about air pollution in my home town (San Francisco), I developed a program using a nearest neighbor algorithm that predicted the air quality in specific locations of the Bay Area. The program was trained off of public API data from surrounding sensors. As a robotics major, I interviewed U-M nurses and designed a medication-dispensing robot to be implemented in U-M hospital pharmacies.

Now, I chase every opportunity to build. 

At Conversely AI, I am building our Lead Optimization Manager, a tool allowing businesses to evaluate their leads from their sales calls. This tool allows businesses to determine the quality and value of their customer leads autonomously. I implemented RAG (retrieval augmented generation), prompt engineering, and LLM training and testing.

I am fascinated at how these single devices can complete, and automate most of the tasks that are in our lives, while also giving us tools that allow us to express our creativity. While I had many different projects in my life, something that I have been passionate about recently is efficiency, and customization. Efficiency allows me to make the most out of my tasks, and removes a lot of the headaches that come with the extra work of having to do a task manually. One project I began, in order to optimize my coding experience, is creating a custom text editor through VIM. Here I start with a basic, and boring editor, and am able to choose what tools I want to include in order to optimize my experience. Other previous projects I worked on were game development, and creating custom websites, as these tools allow me to create something unique. Entrepreneurship has always been a big interest of mine, as it allows one to pursue their own passion, and the ability to be in charge of their own success. 
","I am interested in V1 due to the opportunity it gives creators. I enjoy the freedom that entrepreneurship gives, in allowing one to make their own rules, and follow their own path. One struggle that I have when it comes to creating, is finding the balance at being feasible, yet beneficial. Many of the ideas that come to my mind are just too difficult to do at my current knowledge level. I believe V1 will help me with this, as the knowledge, and combined work, of all the members in the group will allow us to create more difficult projects, opening up more options for uniqueness. The ability to be in a group of other like minded individuals, who are actively looking at creating and managing projects, will push me to pursue my entrepreneurial side, allowing me to get others perspectives on the current state of technology, and what to work on.

For eight months, I experienced the average engineering employee’s lifestyle, yet with every minute I sat whiling away my time in that jail cell I became very certain that I could never pursue such a bland and deterministic career in my future. I was handed document after document, ECOs and EMRs, Excel sheets and circuit schematics. Every order from my manager felt like another year added to a prison sentence.

In all fairness, perhaps I was simply not cut out for computer engineering. However, those eight months made it perfectly clear to me that I couldn’t stand being confined to a rigid corporation’s ideas and structure. If I am to enjoy my work, it will be under my own vision and my own terms. It will necessitate the discussion of my ideas and the inclusion of my perspective on design and execution; in short, the definition of entrepreneurship.

As a CS-focused student with academic pursuits in economics and statistics as well, my ideal future centers around combining these disciplines to build tech, elevating existing urban life and development. The possibilities for tech within a built enviornment are endless–heat-absorbant walls, digital kiosks around confusing streets, automated processes that can equitably distribute resources. There are so many ways still unthought of to promote inclusivity, innovative, and sustainable living and so many ways to enhance residents’ quality of life, all through technology that can be built.

My building journey has just begun, with wandering experimentation with online tutorials and trial and error with web development animations, but I seek a nurturing environment to find an important focus, share my ideas, learn from and collaborate with dedicated people, incorporate my actual passions to hands-on building.","V·1

As a creator passionate about building, from websites for my uncle's real estate business to revamping an electrochemistry research database, I sometimes hit roadblocks with new technologies and their applications. V1's mentorship and product building education deeply interest me. I'm keen to learn new technologies, but guidance on aspects like database selection or framework initiation would be invaluable. I possess a growth mindset and an eagerness to learn, traits that would maximize my benefit from V1's workshops, and later enable me to contribute to the V1 community. Additionally, V1's women in ENTR initiative resonates with me. It offers a chance to connect with fellow women, share challenges, and foster support in a male-dominated field. The opportunity to pursue my passion, guided by expertise and surrounded by a nurturing community, is my ideal scenario.

My journey in the tech world has been a blend of web development, AI, and software engineering. A particular highlight was developing an AI chess algorithm, marrying my love for the game with my tech skills. But my interests extend beyond technology; I'm deeply committed to social change, particularly in mental health. Aware of the barriers in accessing mental health services, such as financial and geographical constraints, I initiated Evergreen Therapy, a social startup backed by Stanford MBA students. While this venture didn't reach its full potential, it was a crucial stepping stone in my journey.

In college, my interest shifted towards product development and business. This transition opened my eyes to the possibility of melding technology with social good – a concept I had touched upon with Evergreen Therapy. The idea of creating products that can drive social change excites me. I see product management as a platform to innovate and address social challenges effectively. Leveraging technology to create impactful solutions that can transform lives and communities is my goal. This intersection of technology, business acumen, and a commitment to social good forms the core of my entrepreneurial spirit.","1. I abhor the beach (cannot deal with the salty water, sand between my toes, and tans!), but I love mountains as they make me remember how small I am in comparison to the rest of the world.

Each endeavor becomes an opportunity to learn and apply analytical thinking.

Participating in hackathons, I crafted various websites, delving into cybersecurity's intricate realm. The Cyberpatriot competition deepened my understanding of computer and networking systems. In my high school's engineering academy, a capstone course allowed me to apply theoretical knowledge practically. Collaborating with company representatives, I developed an automated camera lens cover, showcasing it during a community-wide open house.

Simultaneously, involvement with my Robotics team propelled me into exploring Entrepreneurship and Finance, leading to outreach events and a robust business plan. Combining interests in finance and computer science, I joined MIG Quant, delving into Quantitative Development. This experience broadened my understanding of financial markets and honed skills in developing trading algorithms.

A consistent theme across these projects is my love for problem-solving and creating innovative solutions. With experiences spanning algorithmic trading, cybersecurity, engineering, and entrepreneurship, I am enthusiastic about bringing this passion and skill set to your club, fostering a dynamic and collaborative environment.","V1 provides members with the opportunities to access new programs and features.

They said we couldn't travel with the dog- and so I solved the problem. A new airline! It would carry animals in suitable habitats and transport them from place to place. Of course, it wasn't feasible. But from then on, I built many things. In middle school, I devoted my time to learning robotics and understanding how circuits work-I played with arduino circuits and lego EV3 sets. I had an idea for a security bot which I pursued, but got knocked down because it was very impractical. 

In high school, I started working with web development. Me and my best friend decided to use selenium, a python API for testing, to automate a youtube channel that would read reddit posts. It did well, and that's also how I got into marketing-trying to understand how I could make the channel do better. 

At college, I started working on a sports app to connect players to tournaments worldwide. While it isn't a finished project, I hope to finish it this semester and show it to the amazing minds at V1 for feedback.","V1 will give me access to a strong network of like-minded entrepreneurial people who want to paint the world in their own image. I want to come up with different ideas, I want to try building products in spaces I don't have experience in, I want to try and fail and learn and do so much more. I want to bring my ideas to fruition, and understand what's practical and what needs more time and development.

I want to contribute to dialogue within the entrepreneurial space. I want to contribute my ideas, and my domain knowledge of finance and technology to help build products across different areas. And I hope that a year or 2 after joining V1, I can help new entrepreneurs build their projects and help bring their ideas to life with some guidance.","I'm a certified scuba diver, and I've swam in close proximity to sharks!",
